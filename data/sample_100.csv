When we asked for proof of the “compromise,” Trustico did not provide details on why they were requesting the immediate revocation. Trustico’s CEO indicated that Trustico held the private keys for those certificates, and then emailed us approximately 20,000 certificate private keys. When he sent us those keys, his action gave us no choice but to act in accordance with the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements, which mandate that we revoke a compromised certificate within 24 hours. As a CA, we had no choice but to follow the Baseline Requirements. Following our standard revocation process, we gave notice via email to each certificate holder whose private keys had been exposed to us by Trustico, so they could have time to get a replacement certificate.In communications today, Trustico has suggested that this revocation is due to the upcoming Google Chrome distrust of Symantec roots. That is incorrect. We want to make it clear that the certificates needed to be revoked because Trustico sent us the private keys; this has nothing to do with future potential distrust dates.The upcoming Chrome distrust situation is entirely separate. We are working closely to help customers with certificates affected by the browser distrust, and we are offering free replacement certificates through their existing customer portals.

9939,3906523,2018-02-28 19:46:32,"Spotify has filed to go public0Music streaming service Spotify is going public and it just unveiled its filing.The documents state that it is targeting a $1 billion IPO, but this is just a placeholder. The company actually plans to go public without the standard fundraising event. In other words, Spotify isn’t selling its shares on the stock market. Instead, the event known as a “direct listing” will be a series of transactions from existing shareholders (like employees and investors) selling shares to stock market investors. Spotify’s filing even acknowledges that this unusual process is “risky.”Its public debut is likely to happen in late March or early April, but it is unclear how much shares will cost when it lists under “SPOT” on the New York Stock Exchange. Spotify says that for 2018 its shares have traded on the private markets for between $90 and $132.50, valuing the company at $23.4 billion at the top of the range. But that these transactions “may have little or no relation to the opening public price of our ordinary shares on the NYSE.”Spotify says it is present in 61 countries and its platform includes 159 million monthly active users and 71 million premium subscribers.Total MAUs SpotifyPaying users SpotifySpotify Ad supported usersThe filing shows that the Swedish company had 4.09 billion Euros in revenue last year (or close to $5 billion), compared to 2.95 billion Euros (about $3.6 billion) the year before. 2015 saw 1.94 billion Euros in revenue (about $2.37 billion).Losses for last year were 1.2 billion Euros ($1.46 billion), which compares to 539 million Euros ($657 million) the year before.The filing shows that CEO and co-founder Daniel Ek has voting power that represents 23.8% of the company. However, some of this voting power is on behalf of shares owned by Tiger, TME Hong Kong and Image Frame. Ek technically owns closer to 9% of the business.The prospectus has an additional note about Ek’s compensation, which says that he doesn’t receive a base salary, but is eligible for $1 million annual bonuses based on metrics like subscriber growth and active users.Martin Lorentzon, who co-founded the business, owns 12.4%. Other large shareholders include Tencent, Tiger Global, Sony Music and Technology Crossover Ventures (TCV).There are some key obstacles to the business, which Spotify acknowledges in its risk factors.Some are concerned that Spotify is beholden to music rights owners like record labels who could try to raise rates during periodic re-negotiations if they think the service becomes too profitable. There are also administrative agencies like the Copyright Royalty Board and trade groups like the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers who could seek to increase the rates Spotify has to pay. Control of rights is heavily concentrated within a few major labels and organizations. Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group, and Merlin hold rights for music that accounted for 87% of Spotify’s streams in 2017. They could potentially wreck Spotify’s margins by demanding higher rates or deprive it of content in ways that would drive away listeners.Spotify’s costs could continue to increase as it pays for content, creates its own, builds new features, and markets the service in the face of competition. Spotify’s licensing and royalty agreements are complex and could lead to litigation costs if it doesn’t hit milestones or guaranteed minimum payouts, or doesn’t properly license all the content it streams. Spotify has already been hit with numerous lawsuits for failing to find and pay all rights holders. Its competitors also hold larger patent portfolios that they could use to attack Spotify for intellectual property infringement.Spotify faces competition from all sides and formats. There are traditional formats like CDs and Vinyl, digital files like MP3s and iTunes downloads, terrestrial and satellite radio, online radio like Pandora, and competing on-demand subscription services including Amazon Prime, Apple Music, Deezer, Google Play Music / YouTube, Joox, and SoundCloud. Since Google and Apple own the top mobile app stores, they could potentially bury Spotify and already charge it a tax that doesn’t get applied to their music services. Interestingly, Spotify lists Facebook as a potential competitor, given that it’s building a smart speaker and has struck deals with record labels, although it offers no music streaming service currently.The company writes that“a key differentiating factor between Spotify and other music content providers is our ability to predict music that our Users will enjoy.” Features like Discover Weekly are what keep hardcore listeners on its service, and it will have to find a way to stay ahead of the recommendation engines of its competitors if it wants to win.",Spotify has filed to go public

The all-electric Tesla Model S competitor has a lot of car fans excited, and has been drawing covetous looks since the concept’s unveiling back in 2015. Now that launch is drawing closer, however, we have some new info about the car, how it charges and its performance.Porsche EV lead Stefan Weckbach told a group of journalists that Porsche, unlike Tesla, is developing its car as a performance vehicle that can maintain top speed and reproduce acceleration reliably, specifically calling out Tesla’s vehicles’ ability to do 0 to 60 in under 3 seconds “only twice – the third attempt will fail,” reports Autoblog.He’s likely referring to a software-based restriction on use of Tesla’s Launch Control and aggressive acceleration features, which was limited both in terms of total uses and times it could be used successively to limit its impact on vehicle powertrain parts, as well as the Tesla’s battery. Tesla lifted this limitation in response to customer complaints, however.Besides throwing some mildly outdated shade Tesla’s way, Weckbach also talked about how the vehicle will quick-charge, aging back 250 miles of range during a 20 minute charging session, though that will take a lot of infrastructure expansion in the U.S. and abroad. Tesla’s investment in its Supercharger network begins to look like a smart hedge and early lead in this context.Porsche’s Mission E arrives next year, as mentioned, so it’s basically time to get excited. Tesla fans likely be swayed by cheap shots at their beloved cars, but a battle on performance merits does look to be brewing.",Porsche’s EV lead takes shots at Tesla while hyping the Mission E

When speaking about the kinds of online games historians might want to keep, we used MMORPGS as an example. But there are multiple kinds of online interactions, even in single player games — and some of those are starting to die off as well.As an example, the servers for From Software’s Demon’s Souls shut down today, after 8 years of being online. Now players won’t be able to use any of the game’s online features.Attention all Slayers of Demons: As previously announced, at 09:00 UTC on Feb 28, 2018, the Demon Souls servers will go offline.Our humble thanks for your support over the last 8 amazing years. Please make the most of the remaining time so you may live without regrets.Demon’s Souls, the precursor to the popular Dark Souls series, doesn’t, on the surface, seem like the kind of game that needs online features: It’s a linear, story-driven action RPG that can be finished by a single player, even now that the servers have shut down. All of the online features are, in theory, completely superfluous.That said, Demon’s Souls multiplayer gave the entire game world atmosphere it wouldn’t otherwise have had. Players could invade each other’s games, assist each other in combat, and leave messages for each other. It gave the impression that players had each other as a tether to sanity in an insanely brutal world.Without that interaction, the game is still technically playable, but it loses something. If, for example, the Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment could maintain a server, future players could see what the game is like for those who originally played it.If the Museum doesn’t get the chance to preserve Demon’s Souls‘ online features, then we can only hope From Software’s sophomore effort will wind up on the Nintendo Switch, just as Dark Souls has — and with new servers.The Next Web’s 2018 conference is just a few months away, and it’ll be💥💥.

Titled “dual display equipment with enhanced visibility and suppressed reflections” the patent details a device that could act, essentially, as a giant Touch Bar — switching between a keyboard and content-specific controls.The documentation shows two different configurations: one with a permanent hinge and another that allows the second screen to be removed and used separately, a la Microsoft’s Surface Pro and other two-in-one devices. It also says the device’s main screen would be an OLED display with the secondary device being an LCD screen.It’s an interesting idea, one that could turn the space once reserved for typing into a highly configurable workspace with numerous options for artists, video editors, and casual web browsers. Apple’s Pencil, for example, could be used as a primary input device on a MacBook, and artists could make use of digital tuning knobs, color palettes, and drawing tools that make better use of the space below the main screen.But it’s also forcing users to type on a flat surface without the tactile feel of physical keys. So, there’s that.As usual, it’s worth reminding everyone that a patent is just an idea, and one that is equally likely to end up in the trash as on a future Apple product. And this one, honestly, seems more likely for the former than the latter — at least until someone figures out a way to make flat keys “feel” like real ones.The Next Web’s 2018 conference is just a few months away, and it’ll be💥💥.

This means computers are going to have to get smarter. That’s why Google is studying the human brain and neural networks simultaneously.So far, neuroscience has informed the field of artificial intelligence through endeavors such as the creation of neural networks. The idea is that what doesn’t fool a person shouldn’t be able to trick an AI.A Google research team, which included Ian Goodfellow, the guy who literally wrote the book on deep learning, recently published its white paper: “Adversarial Examples that Fool both Human and Computer Vision.” The work points out that the methods used to fool AI into classifying an image incorrectly don’t work on the human brain. It posits that this information can be used to make more resilient neural networks.Last year when a group of MIT researchers used an adversarial attack against a Google AI all they had to do was embed some simple code into an image. In doing so, that team convinced an advanced neural network it was looking at a rifle, when in fact it was seeing a turtle. Most children over the age of three would’ve known the difference.The problem isn’t with Google’s AI, but with a simple flaw that all computers have: a lack of eyeballs. Machines don’t “see” the world, they simply process images – and that makes it easy to manipulate the parts of an image that people can’t see in order to fool them.To fix the problem, Google is trying to figure out why humans are resistant to certain forms of image manipulation. And perhaps more importantly, it’s trying to discern exactly what it takes to fool a person with an image.According to the white paper published by the team:If we knew conclusively that the human brain could resist a certain class of adversarial examples, this would provide an existence proof for a similar mechanism in machine learning security.Credit: GoogleLeft: original image of a cat. Right: The same image successfully manipulated to fool humans into thinking they’re seeing a dog.In order to make people see the cat as a dog the researchers zoomed in and fudged some of the details. Chances are, it passes at-a-glance, but if you look at it for more than a few seconds it’s obviously a doctored-up image. The point the researchers are making is that it’s easy to fool humans, but only in some ways.Right now people are the undisputed champions when it comes to image recognition. But completely driverless cars will be unleashed on roadways around the world in 2018.

After the iPhone X, other manufacturers were bound to copy the camera notch, and now it seems OnePlus may be one of them.A couple of images showed up on Chinese site ITHome showcasing what’s reportedly a OnePlus 6 (or perhaps OnePlus 7, according to the translation). Of immediate note are the iPhone X-like notch and glass back, and the fingerprint sensor has taken a more oblong shape.Also note that super tiny bottom bezel, which should make it easier to reach the top of the screen. Spec-wise the device appears to have 6 GB of RAM and 64 GB of storage – the same as the most recent two OnePlus devices.The glass back is an unusual choice for OnePlus, which has used metal or plastic on all of its devices except the short-lived OnePlus X back in 2015. The move to a glass back could suggest the company is finally considering adding wireless charging – or maybe it just wants to switch things up. But I’d hope it didn’t opt for a more fragile material without a good reason.Of course, this could very well just be a prototype, so take it all with a grain of salt – if it’s even a legit leak in the first place. The OnePlus 6 wouldn’t be due for several months according to the typical release cycle, so anything can change.Still, the notch isn’t entirely unreasonable; Android P is expected to include native support for formatting apps around the notch.

9945,3922961,2018-03-01 14:30:00,"A promising car that’s a work in progress.Model 3Get more infoEngadgetUsersI was standing next to the Model 3 when a guy on a bike rode by and yelled, ""How is it?"" My typical interactions with people who ask about Tesla's affordable sedan (so many people ask me about the car) typically take about five minutes. I point out the highlights and issues I've encountered while driving. Without thinking, I threw him a thumbs up. It was a gut reaction to a car I've come to adore but have also been confused by. I should have yelled, ""It's complicated!SummaryGallery: Tesla Model 3 review | 39 PhotosTo say the $35,000 Model 3 is important to Tesla would be an understatement. Judging by its pre-orders (the highest the industry has seen), it's already the most anticipated car ever. It's the culmination of CEO Elon Musk's nearly 12-year-old ""master plan"" to bring an affordable EV to market. Now that the Model 3 is here I can positively say it's a joy to drive, but it's also frustrating to do some of the simplest things in the cockpit. During a single trip I went from having an electric-motor-fueled grin on my face to throwing my hands up in exasperation while trying to adjust the cruise control follow distance. So yeah, it's complicated.The relationship (and if you follow any Tesla forums or even hang out at a Supercharger station, you know the owners are in a relationship with their cars) starts out like all new affairs: filled with excitement. Behind the wheel, the Model 3 is the best Tesla. I prefer it to the Model S (yes, even the P100D) as well as the Model X. It's quick but more importantly nimble. It handles corners and is far lighter on its tires than the S or X. It doesn't have the neck-snapping speed of Ludicrous mode, but the Long Range version's 307 pounds of torque coupled with 271 horsepower make for a car that's just asking the driver to punch the accelerator and hit a few curves.The Model 3 also has a very smooth and nearly silent ride. It's quieter than most other EVs, and it glides almost as well as a mid-tier luxury sedan. With a range of 220 miles for the base model and 310 for the Long Range edition, you're going to be spending a good amount of time behind the wheel instead of sitting at a Supercharger.Yet no matter how engrossed you are in the act of driving, the interior of the Model 3 will probably manage to confound you at some point. Some things are just too complex.The act of driving is more than just pressing the accelerator and pointing a car toward its destination. While you're on the road you turn things on and off and adjust various settings. At any given moment, I was changing the temperature or the volume of the radio, adjusting mirrors, using navigation, fine-tuning cruise control and sometimes even adjusting my chair. It's a dynamic experience. As you'll quickly find out, Tesla has moved some of these controls to submenus on the Model 3's giant 15-inch display.To be clear, there are hardware controls in the car, including two buttons on the steering wheel and two stalks on the steering column. The right stalk controls the transmission and turns autopilot on and off. The left stalk is the blinker control and is used for a single wipe and cleaning the windshield. The buttons are programmable by Tesla, but the left one is mostly for controlling your media. But that's it, and the hardware situation (or lack thereof) creates a bunch of issues pertaining to usability.The first time I noticed this I was using Tesla's semiautonomous Autopilot feature. The controls for adjusting the top speed and follow distance of adaptive cruise control are on the wheel and steering stalk on the Model S and X. They're easy to adjust without looking. On the Model 3 you have to tap the display to adjust the cruise control speed. Even worse, you have to go into a submenu to adjust the adaptive cruise control follow distance. First you tap on the car icon, then find and tap on Autopilot in the screen that pops up. Finally, you adjust the follow distance by tapping plus or minus. That's not even close to a better experience, and it's potentially dangerous, because instead of using muscle memory to find and adjust a physical item, you're reaching and tapping while looking to the right.Plus, a few times instead of tapping Autopilot, I hit something else because of a bump. That's an ongoing issue with in-car touchscreens that every automaker should be aware of. But it didn't stop Tesla from making that display the car's primary input device.Adjusting the mirrors also requires a few taps before they become adjustable via the two steering wheel buttons. Typically these are fixed before you start driving, so it's not that bad. But the wipers, that's a different story.As noted earlier, you can enable a single swipe or a cleaning of the windshield via the left stalk. But anything beyond that requires using the touchscreen. The Model 3 does have automatic wipers, which work well most of the time. During a rainstorm, however, it took longer than I was comfortable with to engage and didn't wipe fast enough for my liking. To speed them up, I had to reach over and tap the speed I wanted.If this were any other car or automaker, that would be it. I'd tell you that these usability issues make an otherwise amazing car a pain to drive. But Tesla's cars evolve while sitting in your driveway, and apparently, it's already working on these issues.The ability to adjust the adaptive cruise control speed is coming to the right hardware button on the steering wheel. The wipers are also getting an update that puts a shortcut to start them on the left stalk. Both of these will arrive in the form of over-the-air updates. No word on whether the adaptive cruise control follow distance will also receive hardware-button support.This is where the company shines: the ability to take feedback from owners and reviewers like myself and fix things with a software update. But I can't review a car based on what it'll do in the future. I have to make my assessment based on what's available now. And right now, I'm bewildered as to why these decisions were made in the first place.I'm also annoyed by the lack of a dash cluster behind the steering wheel. The display that was in front of the driver on the Model S and X has been relocated to the left side of the touchscreen display. So you're looking to the right not only to see your speed but also what gear you're in and what the sensors see (which is especially important while parking) as well as to check on blinkers. It's weird for the left blinker to be flashing in your right eye.The lack of a display ahead of the driver is even more noticeable at night. After decades of having something glowing behind the steering wheel, complete darkness from that part of the car is eerie.Tesla isn't the first automaker to move the speedometer to the center of the dash. Mini did it decades ago. In fact, I own a Mini with the speedo in the middle of dash. I hate it. I'm not a fan. It wasn't enough to dissuade me from buying and enjoying my car. But it's something to keep in mind when you're thinking about the Model 3.These are dramatic changes from the Model S and X. Thankfully, though, some things do carry over from those two vehicles. Even though this is the affordable Tesla (its starting price is less than half the price of the base model Model S), if you plunk down $5,000 for the Autopilot option, you're getting the same experience as the other models. Tesla continues to refine its semiautonomous system, which is one of the best in the industry. The Model 3 had very few problems staying centered in its lane and tracking cars. The auto-lane-change option felt a bit more aggressive than the last time I drove a Tesla. Most of the time it was fine, but in one instance it quickly changed lanes, then immediately started braking enough to catch everyone in the car and the vehicle behind me off guard. It's a reminder that none of these systems are ready to be left on their own.Another place where the Tesla excels is its voice control. Even when I flubbed the names of locations, it figured out what I was trying to say. ""Umpire State Building"" was quickly changed to ""Empire State Building"" based on context. It did an outstanding job handling building numbers and parsing the names of friends I wanted to call. Currently, the feature controls navigation, the phone and media playback. But Musk said on Twitter that in the future, voice control would be integrated more into the vehicle's control, which is great news. But it'll be better when that actually happens.Definitely. You will be able to do pretty much anything via voice command. Software team is focused on core Model 3 functionality right now, but that will be done soon, then we will add a lot more features.That's what's so infuriating, because being behind the wheel of the Model 3 puts a smile on my face. It delivers on so many levels, and yet when I have to do things that would be simple in any other car, here it involves tapping and swiping when I should be looking at the road. That's frustrating. If this were a horrible car, it would be fine: You chalk it up to an overall failure of the automaker. A bad vehicle is a bad vehicle. But it's not. It's a great car held back by weird decisions. Tesla says it's working on these issues. That's great, but I can't judge a car I haven't driven yet.So I have to caveat the hell out of this car. It's great on the road and the tech is top notch, but using some of the most important features are a pain and potentially dangerous to operate. The plus side (but not really) is that if you order the car today it'll be 12 to 18 months before it's delivered. By then, hopefully, Tesla will have a user interface that's worthy of a car as great as the Model 3. Because right now, it's complicated.",Tesla Model 3 review: the fast and infuriating
9946,3922962,2018-03-01 15:00:00,"The best cameras under $1,000Enthusiast cameras like Sony's A7R III, the Nikon D850 and Fujifilm's X-H1 get a lot of attention. The good news is that nowadays, you can spend less than $1,000 for a camera body and get almost as much as you would with a model with three times the price. Cameras like Nikon's D5600, the Sony A6300 and Fujifilm's X-T20 handle both photos and video superbly. As you'd expect, though, each model has a different combination of strengths and weaknesses. This guide is meant to help you figure out which best fits your needs.The basicsBuying a camera revolves around three decisions: Do you want a fixed or interchangeable lens camera? If it's the latter, would you rather have a mirrorless or DSLR? And finally, what size sensor do you want: full-frame, APS-C, Micro Four Thirds or smaller?If you want the lightest camera possible for travel or street photography, consider a compact, fixed-lens model. Many, including Panasonic's Lumix ZS200 and Sony's RX100 V, are highly pocketable but provide excellent quality. And just because you're getting a fixed lens doesn't mean you have to settle for a small sensor. Panasonic's excellent LX100 comes with a Micro Four Thirds chip and costs less than $1,000.DSLRs offer a direct, optical viewfinder and generally focus more quickly than mirrorless models. That makes them ideal for sports and wildlife photography, but many folks might find them too heavy to take on vacation. Unfortunately, Canon, Nikon and Sony don't sell any DSLRs with 4K for less than $1,000.Those looking for the best video quality will thus need a mirrorless camera. Luckily, there are great midrange models from Panasonic, Olympus, Sony and (finally) Canon. Mirrorless cameras are better than DSLRs if you're looking to travel light, as many models are highly compact when equipped with small pancake lenses.If portraits, videos and art photography are your passion, you'll probably want the largest sensor possible. That makes it easier to separate your subject by blurring out the background, creating a bokeh effect. Full-frame sensors are best for that, but there's only one model under a grand, Sony's original A7. APS-C is the next-best choice and creates more bokeh than Micro Four Thirds.Best midrange mirrorless camerasThe mirrorless midrange category can be confusing, because there are so many excellent models. Unlike with DSLRs, it's easy to find 4K and in-body stabilization, and models from Sony, Olympus, Panasonic and Fujifilm are now crammed with innovative features.For instance, mirrorless cameras are closing the speed gap with DSLRs in terms of autofocus, thanks to a new generation of phase-detect sensor models from Sony, Fujifilm and other companies. Electronic viewfinders (EVFs) are better than ever and arguably superior to optical viewfinders because you can see the final result. Basically, then, most camera innovation is happening in the mirrorless category, making it the most worthy of your consideration, in my opinion. Here are the best of the best.Fujifilm X-T20Olympus' O-MD EM-10 Mark III is a stellar camera, but Fujifilm's $900 X-T20 wins on several counts. First off, it has a larger APS-C 24.3-megapixel X-Trans III sensor that instantly buys you better bokeh and low-light performance. It offers a 2.3-million dot OLED EVF and touchscreen, which its pricier X-T2 sibling doesn't have, giving you tap to focus and shoot plus swiping and zooming to review images. It can focus in just .06 seconds and shoot in burst mode at 5 fps.There's also 4K video at 30 fps, a microphone input and various creative filters for the amateur crowd. And don't forget Fujifilm's impressive and reasonably priced lens collection. Most importantly for many of its fans, the X-T20 has classic, retro good looks and is easy to operate, thanks to no fewer than five dials for mode, exposure compensation, aperture, ISO and shutter speed. On the downside, the X-T20 lacks in-body stabilization.Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IIISpeaking of beautiful, easy-to-use and impressively specced cameras, let's talk about the $650 Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark III. It beats the X-T20 in one key area: Namely, it has 5-axis in-body stabilization, something sadly lacking in all Fujifilm models except the new X-H1. The OM-D E-M10 Mark III also has some drawbacks like the smaller 16.1-megapixel, Micro Four Thirds sensor and lack of a microphone port.It equals the X-T20 with 4K video and features a 2.36-million-dot viewfinder and the same image processor as the one on Olympus' super-quick OM-D E-M1 Mark II. It's also small and light, and Olympus has a wide and impressive selection of Micro Four Thirds lenses, including the new f/1.2 prime lens lineup with enough bokeh to help you forget about that smallish sensor. As with the X-T20, the E-M10 Mark III is lovely and packs manual dials, saving you from plunging into menus.The drawbacks are a clumsy menu system, lack of mechanical dials and poor battery life. All told, though, shooters who do both video and audio will be better off with the A6300 than many of the pricier models out there.Honorable mention: Sony A7Sony's original A7 is still available for $800 (body only) and less than $1,000 with the 28-70mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens. So why would you buy a circa-2013 camera? Well, it has a 24.3-megapixel sensor and offers 1080/60p/24p HD video with both microphone and headphone jacks, crucial for videographers. Most importantly, it's a full-frame camera, giving you maximum bokeh and support for a growing number of full-frame lenses from Sony and others.Our top DSLR picksDSLRs are the weak point of the midrange-camera category, as they lack features like 4K and in-body stabilization that can be found in mirrorless and even compact models. Nikon finally released an APS-C model with 4K, the $1,300 D7500, so let's hope that trend continues in 2018. If you're looking to get a current midrange model for less than $1,000, however, you'll need to forget about those things and decide which cameras handle best, shoot the fastest and have the best-quality images for your needs. Here are our top three picks.Canon EOS 77DCanon's $800 EOS 77D and Nikon's D5600 are the best midrange DSLRs released recently and are close in specs, but the 77D gets the nod as our top pick. Released last year, it inherited some nice features from Canon's higher-end models. That includes a fast, accurate 45-point phase-detection system and Canon's Dual Pixel AF -- the best in the business for live view and video modes. Max burst shooting is 6 fps, and ISO tops out at 51,200 (extended), though shots beyond ISO 12,800 are extremely noisy.If you can live without 4K and settle for 1080p at 60 fps, the 77D actually has a lot to offer for video. You get surprisingly good electronic stabilization that works in concert with the optical lens IS, a flip-out screen for easier self-shooting and vlogging, and fast, accurate Dual Pixel autofocus. It also has WiFi, Bluetooth and NFC, so it's easy to remotely control the 77D and download photos.Nikon D5600Engadget and plenty of other sites have given Nikon grief for its lack of innovation compared to rivals like Sony. The $650 D5600 is a solid case in point, being merely a minor refresh over its predecessor, the D5500, and lacking features like 4K and in-body stabilization. But that's where the DSLR world is right now, and the D5600 still has enough to recommend it.Namely, you get excellent dynamic range and detail from the 24-megapixel APS-C sensor that, don't forget, is a touch larger than those on Canon cameras. The 34-point autofocus system for regular photo shooting is excellent, though Nikon is lagging well behind Canon's Dual Pixel autofocus for video and live-view shooting.Most importantly, perhaps, the D5600 is about as light as a DSLR gets, so it's feasible to lug it along on your vacation. It also has a nice touchscreen that flips around, making selfies and vlogging manageable. Finally, Nikon offers decent wireless connectivity for the D5600 via its SnapBridge option.Hopefully, 2018 will be a better year for Nikon. The D850 was a promising start, and the company needs to put features like 4K and five-axis stabilization into lower-end models to match Olympus, Sony and other rivals.Canon EOS Rebel T7iTrying to find the third-best DSLR shows the problems with this category. A few cameras, like Nikon's D7200 and Canon's 80D, are worth considering, but they were released in 2015 and 2016, respectively. In a market where things change so quickly, I chose Canon's $750 EOS Rebel T7i.While it doesn't ooze excitement, the T7i does key things well. It's nearly identical to the EOS 77D, with 6 fps shooting speeds, WiFi, NFC and Bluetooth connections, a top ISO of 51,200, and a flippable screen. It focuses quickly and accurately whether in regular or live view/video mode, thanks to the phase-detect and Dual Pixel autofocus systems. And yet it's much smaller and lighter, making it a good travel camera for folks who must have a DSLR.Compact camerasAnyone who's wielded a Sony RX100 or Leica Q can understand why photographers are passionate about fixed-lens, compact cameras. Being able to whip out a camera and instantly yet discreetly snap great photos is a godsend for travelers and creative photographers.Manufacturers keep upping the ante in this category in order to sway photographers away from smartphones. As a result, there are some astonishingly great models for less than $1,000 (and many that cost more, like Fujifilm's X100F and Canon's G1X Mark III, but I'll save those for my forthcoming enthusiast guide).Sony RX100 VAs with the mirrorless category, it's tough to choose a winner here. But the $980 Sony RX100 V's pure technical competence and tiny size make up for its operational minuses, which is why it's often used as a second camera by professional photographers.Where to start? The 20.1-megapixel, 1-inch sensor RX100 V can shoot an astonishing 24 RAW photos per second and handle 4K, 30 fps video with a full sensor readout. Low-light capability is great for a compact, aided by the f/1.8-2.5 24-70mm lens, and it uses Sony's latest BSI sensor tech with 315-point phase-detect AF.That said, the RX100 V is pricey, and meanwhile the handling is clumsy compared to models from Panasonic and others. Sony needs to redesign its menu system, in my opinion, but seems to have resisted doing much with it so far because sales have been so good.Panasonic Lumix ZS200I picked Panasonic's Lumix ZS100 as one of the top compact cameras for my recent camera-buying guide. Since then, the company has released the ZS200, which succeeds and improves on it in most ways. You still get a 1-inch, 20.1-megapixel sensor; 5-axis in-body stabilization; a 2,330K-dot EVF; and 4K video at 30 fps.What the new model brings is a new L.Monochrome black-and-white shooting mode and a 15x, 24-360 zoom (35mm equivalent), a big jump from the last model's 10x, 25-250x lens. In exchange, unfortunately, you lose a stop of speed, jumping from f/2.8-5.9 to f/3.3-6.4. Nevertheless, the wider zoom range will probably be more useful for the ZS200's intended tourist market, helping vacationers snap distant wildlife or beach action.Panasonic Lumix LX100Panasonic's aging LX100 gets on this list because it's the only model for less than $1,000 with a sensor larger than one inch. It packs a Micro Four Thirds, 12.8-megapixel chip and f/1.7-2.8 24-75mm equivalent lens, letting you easily separate subjects from backgrounds with plenty of bokeh.Despite hitting the market in 2015, the LX100 also offers 4K video, embarrassing more-recent models from the likes of Canon. It also looks great and has physical dials and buttons for easier handling. The LX100 is a bit large and the zoom range is limited, however, so it may not be the best option for travelers. On the other hand, it's a perfect street- and people-photography camera.Wrap-upFive hundred dollars to $1,000 is a sweet price spot for camera buyers right now, and you can't go wrong with any of my picks. That said, unless there's a particular reason you need a DSLR, I would avoid that category and stick with mirrorless models instead. The latter are more technically competent, especially for video, and are lighter and easier to carry, to boot.Meanwhile, there's no longer a need to look down on fixed-lens compacts. The models mentioned here are not a hassle at all to take on holidays but are capable of putting smartphone photos to shame.Steve should have known that civil engineering was not for him when he spent most of his time at university monkeying with his 8086 clone PC.

9947,3922963,2018-03-01 20:45:00,"The first Android Go phones blend low prices with lots of promiseThe world's first Android Go phones debuted here at Mobile World Congress, and they just might change the way Android works for the developing world. We took some time to get acquainted with some of these new devices, but in case you're not entirely up to speed on Go itself, we've prepared this handy primer.What is Android Oreo Go Edition?Easy. In short, it's a customized build of Android Oreo meant to run better on inexpensive phones. (It's also more generically referred to as Android Go, and I'm going to stick with that name.) Google announced it at its I/O developer conference for devices with 1GB or less of RAM, but it's appealing for more than just the way it manages performance.Android Go doesn't take as much as space as typical Android, for one, so you don't have to worry as much about running out of memory. Data usage is more of a concern in some markets than others, so Google has also released a handful of Go-optimized apps (think YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail and more) that attempt to minimize data costs. Hell, even the version of the Play Store on Go phones has been tweaked -- it highlights apps Google knows will run well on these more limited devices.YNETWhy does this matter?Let's say you wanted to buy a brand new Android phone for $100 -- there's a strong chance you'd wind up with a phone running a slightly dated version of Android. Those phones (obviously) lack some of the features found in up-to-date models. Even though everyone (more or less) has access to the same apps, the experience of using Android can differ pretty wildly depending on the hardware you're working with.Android Go, then, is an attempt to level the playing field a little and ensure that the Android experience is more consistent across all kinds of devices. Android Go won't make a $100 phone feel as fast as a flagship, but it'll bring important Oreo features to a wider audience and help make sure inexpensive phones aren't awful to use. That's the idea, anyway.What's using an Android Go phone like?Now we're getting to the fun stuff. Brands like ZTE, General Mobile, Micromax and Lava have brought the first Go phones here to MWC, but I spent most of my time playing with two phones in particular. We saw Alcatel's 1X early on in the show, and it's fascinating because it squeezes a 5.3-inch 18:9 screen into such an inexpensive body. That display ran at what Alcatel calls ""VGA+"" so it's not the crispest thing you'll ever see, but for €99 (or about $120) that's no great sin.Driving the phone was a quad-core MediaTek chipset with 1GB of RAM, and it ran generally well... at least until I started firing up too many apps and jumped between them a lot. Alcatel later told me this was because the phone's software was far from final, but it was a reminder that Android Go's existence doesn't obviate the need for good software engineering.Gallery: Meet the first Android Go phones | 11 PhotosThe 1X is also a great example of the kind of control Google doesn't exercise over its Android Go partners. Alcatel's Go phone uses a non-stock launcher and has a handful of preloaded apps, so nothing but good sense is preventing device makers from painting over (and potentially slowing down) stock Oreo Go.I was more fond of the Nokia 1, a small, charming device with a surprisingly nice 4.7-inch screen. When I first walked into Nokia's booth to take a look at the thing, I thought the company had put dummy phones up on display because the 1's screen looked so crisp and nicely saturated. The joke's on me, I guess. The Nokia 1 uses a quad-core MediaTek chipset and 1GB of RAM as well, but overall it felt much more stable and smooth-running than the Alcatel 1X. Launching apps sometimes took an extra moment, but it was never frustrating and I couldn't trip it up by jumping between multiple apps the way I could with the Alcatel. The new version's 5-megapixel camera is obviously not great and its polycarbonate design can feel lacking, but all told it's a strong (and cute) package for just $85.Chris Velazco/EngadgetAnd there are Google's Go Edition apps. They're low-impact versions of existing apps and in the case of Gmail and YouTube, they seem to work just as well as their standard counterparts. YouTube Go worked fine as well, though I didn't get a chance to try its best feature: the ability to download videos and share them with other devices. I put one relatively new Go-optimized app through its paces, though: Google Assistant. Originally exclusive to Google's Pixel phones, the company announced it would expand Assistant support to other Android phones at MWC last year. The catch? Among other things, Android phones needed at least 1.5GB of RAM to use the feature.Not anymore, though. Since most of Assistant's work happens in the cloud, it functioned just as well on this $85 phone as it does on my Pixel 2 XL. The only real difference is that you can't invoke it with an ""OK, Google"" -- it requires a tap on the app icon. Even so, it's pretty great.So, what happens next?That's a tough one -- none of these devices have gone on sale yet, and the actions of the companies that make them depend on people's response to them. Google, however, told the Indian Express it would make Android Go versions of all future Android builds since it's core to the company's commitment to entry-level devices. You might have only just heard of Android Go, but it's not going anywhere.You can also expect some super-cheap Go phones to appear, too -- Google suggested we'd see some sell for as low as $50, but the least expensive we've seen so far is the $80 ZTE Tempo Go. (Turkey's General Mobile India-based Lava and Micromax haven't said how much their Go phones will cost.) We're cautiously optimistic. This is early days for Android Go, and it may well change how people around the world get to experience Android. The lack of control over what OEMs can do to Go Phones may mean some problems low-end phones face are never resolved. We'll just have to wait and see.Chris is Engadget's senior mobile editor and moonlights as a professional moment ruiner. His early years were spent taking apart Sega consoles and writing awful fan fiction. That passion for electronics and words would eventually lead him to covering startups of all stripes at TechCrunch. The first phone he ever swooned over was the Nokia 7610, because man, those curves.",The first Android Go phones blend low prices with lots of promise
9948,3922964,2018-03-01 13:36:00,"An LG G7 showed up in Barcelona after allAfter revealing an AI-powered version of its late-2017 flagship, LG seemed to be having a quiet MWC. As it turns out, the real action was happening elsewhere. Israeli news site YNET posted a brief hands-on of a smartphone called the G7 (NEO) that appears to pack a Qualcomm 845 chipset and a 6-inch, 19.5:9 OLED screen with a notch carved into the top. YNET's report further suggests the device could come with either 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, or 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, as well as a 16-megapixel dual camera. Given its name and its apparent horsepower, this just might be the new flagship phone LG was planning to reveal after MWC, though the company stopped well short of confirming that.An LG spokesperson told Engadget that the phone in question was a ""concept,"" and that LG never had this particular device at its main MWC booth. (That sadly means we couldn't talk our way into some hands-on time of our own.) That spokesperson also added that ""carriers and business partners always get to see early concepts"" at trade shows like this one, which may indicate LG is trying to firm up its sales channel partners ahead of an upcoming announcement and launch.Had LG shown this device off at MWC proper, it would've been in good company. Quite a few smartphone makers embraced notched screen designs this year. While some are relative unknowns -- like Noa and Leagoo -- ASUS notably paired a notched display of its own with a Snapdragon 845 in its new Zenfone 5Z. Like it or not, it looks like 2018 is going to be the year of the notch.Given the G7's concept status, though, it's possible LG may not join the notch club after all. VentureBeat's Evan Blass noted in a tweet that this might be a version of the G7 that was ultimately scrapped in favor of the ""Judy"" design and its super bright, low power display. If the rumors hold true, the Judy flagship will be announced sometime in June -- looks like we won't have to wait too long to start getting some actual answers.",An LG G7 showed up in Barcelona after all
9949,3922965,2018-03-01 18:30:00,"Pico CGet more infoEngadgetCriticUsersPicoBrew has made a name for itself with a range of beer-making appliances that promise a ""set it and forget it"" experience. The company covers the gamut of brewing levels, from the Zymatic (now Z Series) for pros to the Pico Pro and Pico C for intermediate folks and beginners, respectively. While PicoBrew's entire product line offers WiFi connectivity for remote monitoring of the process, its PicoPaks make the whole process even easier by bundling all the ingredients into a simple, self-contained pod. However, as I found with the $499 Pico C, that simplicity has one big trade-off.Gallery: PicoBrew Pico C review | 20 PhotosIf you're not familiar with PicoBrew's gear, every model works more or less the same. The devices are the size of kitchen appliances (think Instant Pot for the smaller C and large convection oven for the Zymatic) and have a clear drawer that holds all the ingredients and works as a mash tun to create your wort. Each connects to a keg that serves as both boil kettle and fermentation tank. Once you put in your ingredients and add the proper amount of water, you select the recipe and hit start -- the machine does the rest. And a couple hours later (when your wort has cooled), you add your yeast and start turning that sugar water into beer through the magic of fermentation. It's this type of all-in-one setup that makes PicoBrew's line of products a compelling option -- at least for those who don't like tending to a brew kettle during the whole process.The Pico C's all-black exterior won't look too out of place if you leave it on your kitchen counter all the time. I actually prefer it to the silver/chrome combo on the Pico Pro, but I have black appliances, so it fits right in. The only real issue with leaving it out is that it takes up quite a bit of counter space: It's 16 x 12 x 14 inches (H x W x D). However, it did fit under my cabinets, so that means you can tuck it in a corner between brew sessions. You'll likely want to store the kegs and other gear elsewhere.SetupOnce you unpack everything, setting up for your first brew takes about 15 minutes. You'll have to connect to your home WiFi and register the unit before you do anything else. Then you run a 10-minute rinse cycle with distilled water and a brew keg. When it's complete, drain the water from the reservoir on top of the Pico C, dump it and rinse both the clear drawer (Step Filter) and brew keg. The system is now ready.PicoPaksIn order to make beer with the Pico C, you'll need a PicoPak. These prepackaged-ingredient containers debuted on the Pico Pro, and they make the process super easy for someone just wading into homebrewing. However, they can be incredibly limiting for someone with a bit of experience like myself. Yes, they are super convenient, but you have to order them from PicoBrew or a licensed retailer and wait for them to arrive. Depending on your shipping method, this could take about a week. That may not sound like a long wait, but it does mean you can't have a spur-of-the-moment brew day.Since the Pico C doesn't work with loose grains and hops, you can't just run out to your local homebrew shop on a Saturday morning. PicoBrew says ""a limited number"" of physical locations stock PicoPaks, but unless your local Best Buy has them on the shelf, you're out of luck. A few other retailers -- Bed, Bath & Beyond, Home Depot and more -- sell the PicoPaks online, but if you're having them shipped, you might as well order direct from the source.Basically brewing with the Pico C requires you to plan ahead -- something I'm not good at.If you're ordering from PicoBrew's website, you can choose from a selection of more than 100 packs based on recipes from professionals and homebrewers. There are versions of commercially available beers like Rogue's Dead Guy Ale and 21st Amendment's Brew Free or Die IPA, just to name a couple. You can also use a recipe of your own to create a so-called Freestyle PicoPak. Or if you need a jumping-off point, you can pick a base beer and adjust the hops and grains as you see fit. For example, if you wanted to make a single-hop IPA with Citra, you could start with the American IPA base and tweak the hops before ordering.There are some constraints though. I'm a big fan of Mosaic hops, so I initially wanted to use that base IPA recipe to make a single-hop beer when I hit a snag: PicoBrew doesn't offer Mosaic for the Freestyle option. In fact, there are only eight hop varieties available for those going the DIY route. I understand not being able to stock every type of hops, but the lack of popular ones like Chinook and Mosaic is disappointing. The company says it is constantly adding new recipes and will add to the Freestyle option as well. New brewers will eventually want to experiment, though, so expanding those DIY packs will be key.BrewingWhen you're ready to brew, all you have to do is turn the machine on and place your PicoPak in the Step Filter (the clear drawer). The Pico C automatically recognizes the Pak and pulls in the proper times and temperatures for that recipe. PicoBrew's instructions are clear and easy, but the device itself will walk you through the steps on the digital display, just in case. It'll even guide you through the cleanup process.Once everything is in place, simply hit start. The display will keep you updated on which step it's on and how much time is left. You can also track the process on PicoBrew's web-based BrewHouse interface. It isn't quite as handy as a mobile app, but it works just fine. The company says it's working on a dedicated app, but the software is currently in the testing phase, so there's no word on a release date yet.One thing you need to be aware of when brewing with the Pico C is how loud it is. During the brewing process, the machine is about twice as loud as my dishwasher. This means if I'm watching Electric Dreams in the next room while brewing in the kitchen, I have to really crank the volume on the TV. It's certainly not a dealbreaker, but it's something you should know before investing in the device. Once the brewing is complete and you've pitched your yeast, the fermentation process and the wait begin.Fermentation and the PicoFermThe PicoFerm is an optional $59 WiFi sensor that attaches to the top of a brew keg so that you can monitor progress remotely. You don't need this to make beer with a Pico (it's only available for pre-order right now), but it does allow you to track temperature and air pressure (attenuation) in your keg using the web app. The site will also tell you how many days are left in the fermentation process, though since it doesn't monitor gravity, there's some room for error.I used the PicoFerm on two of the three batches I made. If you don't use the sensor, you lose some of the guidance of the PicoBrew system -- and a big part of its appeal. You can still hit ""ferment"" on the website and it will estimate when the process is complete, but it's not actually monitoring anything. For some, that peace of mind is worth the extra cost. I will say that the PicoFerm worked well for me, consistently sending data while the beer was fermenting. The only time I had an issue was when I forgot to reconnect to WiFi after a couple weeks between batches, but that was pure user error.Kegging and bottlingWhen the beer is finished, which takes about 7 to 14 days depending on the recipe, it's time to keg or bottle. The Pico C comes with a three-liter serving keg that makes packaging your brew super easy. Just select the correct mode in the menu and the device will pump your beer into the mini keg or bottles for you with the included tools. If you've homebrewed before and used a racking cane and bottling wand, this is similar but a lot less messy.There's a force-carbonation kit that you can use to infuse your beer with CO2 in about 36 hours, or you can go old school and use priming sugar to condition your beer naturally over the course of about two weeks. Carbonation can be fickle, and even after a few batches, I wasn't able to dial in the levels I wanted. Both methods worked okay but weren't precise. That's not necessarily a knock against PicoBrew; sometimes these things just need to be fine-tuned over time, especially when you're using a new package size and brewing system.I'll admit I was skeptical of what the Pico C could produce in terms of overall quality, but I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted the results. Each batch was pretty solid, but the batch based on Tallgrass Brewing's Buffalo Sweat Oatmeal Cream Stout and my Freestyle PicoPak single-hop Citra IPA were the standouts. The Pico C makes brewing easy, but most importantly it makes good beer.CompetitionThe Pico C is limited, though, and the initial $499 investment is pretty steep. For as little as $60 you can put together a beginner's brewing kit of your own or buy a prepackaged one. Yes, it's a bit more labor intensive to brew in your kitchen or on a burner in the garage, but you could certainly use that extra money to buy more ingredients or expand your system to make more beer or higher-quality beer. Of course, if you'd rather not futz around with it, there are plenty of semiautomated options.If you have a draft setup, consider splurging for the $799 Pico Pro. Instead of a proprietary Pico Keg, the Pro uses the more standard cornelius kegs (ships with two). But it brews the same amount per batch as the C and still requires you to use PicoPaks.If you'd rather not bother with the PicoPaks, the Zymatic (which will soon be replaced by the Z Series) will cost you. The Zymatic is priced at $1,999, and the modular Z Series will start at $2,500 (discounted to $1,499 during the pre-order phase). Both options whip up 2.5-gallon batches, but the Z Series can scale up to 10 gallons total in 2.5-gallon increments.If you're a little more serious about brewing but still want some automation, there's the Grainfather. You'll have to supply your own fermenter, but glass carboys are cheap and even a bucket from Home Depot will do in a pinch. But otherwise the Grainfather is an all-in-one setup where you can mash, boil and cool your wort with precise temperature control. You can make batches up to 25 liters (6.6 gallons) and control everything from an app. You can even set a timer: Fill it up with water before bed and wake up in the morning ready to start brewing. But at $1,000, it's definitely targeted at experienced homebrewers. Brewie is another automated all-grain option that lets you use whatever ingredients you like, but it too is very expensive ($1,900), so it's made for serious homebrewers as well.Wrap-upPicoBrew set out to make a Keurig-like device for brewing beer, and it has largely succeeded. The Pico C is an easy-to-use machine that makes good beer on your kitchen counter while you watch TV or work on other things. Beginners will definitely appreciate the simplicity and hand-holding, but if you get the urge to experiment, the C could get frustrating. Currently, the PicoPaks have a very limited selection of ingredients, especially hops. Plus you have to really plan ahead. If you're good at that, then you won't have too many headaches. I, however, am not, so relying on PicoPaks is a major inconvenience. Even though the machine works great and it consistently made good beer, I just couldn't get past that limitation.A tech writer by day and a graphic designer by night, Billy was ushered into the gadget world by an Atari and its vices: Frogger and Grand Prix.

9950,3923055,2018-02-26 00:00:00,"How Modern Art Serves the RichMore art is being produced and sold than ever before, at ever higher prices.February 26, 2018During the late 1950s and 1960s, Robert and Ethel Scull, owners of a lucrative taxi company, became fixtures on the New York gallery circuit, buying up the work of then-emerging Abstract Expressionist, Minimalist, and Pop artists in droves. Described by Tom Wolfe as “the folk heroes of every social climber who ever hit New York”—Robert was a high school drop-out from the Bronx—the Sculls shrewdly recognized that establishing themselves as influential art collectors offered access to the upper echelons of Manhattan society in a way that nouveau riche “taxi tycoon” did not.Then, on October 18, 1973, in front of a slew of television cameras and a packed salesroom at the auction house Sotheby Parke Bernet, they put 50 works from their collection up for sale, ultimately netting $2.2 million—an unheard of sum for contemporary American art. More spectacular was the disparity between what the Sculls had initially paid, in some cases only a few years prior to the sale, and the prices they commanded at auction: A painting by Cy Twombly, originally purchased for $750, went for $40,000; Jasper Johns’s Double White Map, bought in 1965 for around $10,000, sold for $240,000. Robert Rauschenberg, who had sold his 1958 work Thaw to the Sculls for $900 and now saw it bring in $85,000, infamously confronted Robert Scull after the sale, shoving the collector and accusing him of exploiting artists’ labor. In a scathing essay published the following month in New York magazine, titled “Profit Without Honor,” the critic Barbara Rose described the sale as the moment “when the art world collapsed.”In retrospect, the Sculls’ auction looks more like the beginning than the end. By today’s standards, the then-record-breaking prices—even adjusted for inflation—sound almost quaint. In November 2013, the Post-War and Contemporary evening sale at Christie’s totaled $691.6 million, setting a new record for the most expensive work by a living artist—$58.4 million for Jeff Koons’s sculpture Balloon Dog. Christie’s proceeded to break its own record auction totals twice more in the next year, with the November 2014 Contemporary sale raking in $852.9 million in a single evening. Meanwhile, this past fall, Christie’s sold a recently rediscovered painting attributed to Leonardo da Vinci for upwards of $450 million, making it the most expensive work ever sold at auction. It’s telling that Christie’s chose to include it in their Post-War and Contemporary sale rather than one devoted to Old Masters where it logically belonged, attesting to the privileged place of contemporary art within today’s art market.What was once a niche trade has expanded into a global industry bound up with luxury, fashion, and celebrity.In her 2014 book Big Bucks: The Explosion of the Art Market in the Twenty-First Century, the veteran art market reporter Georgina Adam surveyed the forces that propelled the stratospheric rise in the market for contemporary art, attempting to explain why, for instance, one version of Andy Warhol’s 1963 screen print Liz could sell for $2 million in 1999 and another from the same series for $24 million in 2007, only a few years later. What was once a niche trade overwhelmingly based in the United States and Western Europe has expanded into a global industry bound up with luxury, fashion, and celebrity, attracting an expanded range of ultra-wealthy buyers who aggressively compete for works by brand-name artists. “When I started out, 30 years ago, millionaires had boats and jets—but didn’t necessarily have any art at all,” Thomas Seydoux, the former chairman of Impressionist and Modern art at Christie’s tells Adam. “For the very wealthy today, it’s not fine not to be interested in art.”In her follow-up Dark Side of the Boom: The Excesses of the Art Market in the Twenty-First Century, Adam, a longtime editor at the Art Newspaper and contributor to the Financial Times, considers the negative effects this influx of money has had on the art itself. As contemporary art is increasingly viewed as an asset class—alongside equities, bonds, and real estate—Adam sees artworks often used as a vehicle to hide or launder money, and artists encouraged to churn out works in market-approved styles, bringing about a decline in quality.Art’s imbrication in networks of money and power is hardly a contemporary phenomenon. Many of the great masterpieces of Renaissance art, for instance, were commissioned by members of the nobility. The origins of the modern picture trade date arguably to the 17thcentury Dutch Republic, where, in the absence of monarchical or church patronage, artists began producing domestically-scaled genre paintings for sale on the open market. In the early 20th century, the art dealer Joseph Duveen—later the 1st Baron Duveen of Millbank—made a fortune selling Old Master paintings he acquired from cash-poor European aristocrats to wealthy American industrialists like Andrew Mellon. As Duveen famously quipped, “Europe has a great deal of art, and America has a great deal of money.” What has changed is speed and scale: There is, Adam argues, more art being produced and sold than ever before, as artists, galleries, and auction houses attempt to keep up with the demand of a new class of international “UHNWIs,” Ultra High Net Worth Individuals attracted by the lure of profit and prestige.DARK SIDE OF THE BOOM: THE EXCESSES OF THE ART MARKET IN THE 21ST CENTURY by Georgina AdamLund Humphries , 208 pp., $34.99As Adam describes, two significant changes at the end of the 20thcentury set the stage for today’s inflated contemporary art market. The first was the expansion of the base of potential buyers: The fall of communism in Eastern Europe and economic liberalization in countries like China and India created a new wave of billionaires eager to flaunt their wealth. In China, which has consistently ranked among the top three largest art markets by value since 2009, demand has also been boosted by a government-sponsored museum-building boom. Over 1000 new museums, a combination of state-run and private institutions, have opened in the past decade; as of 2017, there were approximately 200 privately owned museums devoted to contemporary art. Crucially, building private museums serves not only as a status symbol for the country’s elite, but a means of gaining state approval for lucrative real estate development deals.The second major change was the shift away from Old Masters and Impressionists as the core of the auction business. Historically, selling contemporary art had been the province of galleries and private dealers; the work of living artists went to auction only infrequently. But the major auction houses, Sotheby’s and Christie’s, recognized that promoting the contemporary market could open up vast new revenue streams. They began to function more like luxury brands. Christie’s was in fact purchased in 1998 by François Pinault, the owner of the European luxury retail conglomerate Kering whose brands include Gucci, Saint Laurent, and Balenciaga. The houses began aggressively hyping a never-ending flow of new inventory, and with it, a jet-set lifestyle of multi-million dollar auctions, exclusive gallery dinners, and VIP art fair vernissages.Auction houses also began to expand into financial services for this expanded range of “UHNWI” clients, offering collectors lines of credit, allowing them to borrow against the value of their collections, and sometimes selling works with third-party guarantees, in which the house effectively pre-sells a lot before the auction and may split some share of the proceeds with the guarantor if it ultimately goes for more than the agreed-upon price. The result is that the prices for contemporary art have risen higher and higher, which in turn attracts new buyers, many of them drawn in by the money alone. “I know some Rothko buyers—some of the key market makers today—who didn’t know who Rothko was until he reached $40 million,” says former Phillips auction house chairman Simon de Pury, quoted in Dark Side of the Boom. “When they saw a good work could sell in the $40 to $60 million range, they suddenly said, ‘this is really interesting!’”Critiques of the art market’s rise often revolve around anxieties about art’s commodification: What happens to the notion of art as a public good when its value is primarily measured in dollars? But that isn’t the only thing at stake. In the book’s final section, Adam examines the ways in which the notoriously secretive art business, coupled with lax regulatory oversight, has enabled vast sums of money to change hands without public scrutiny. She cites a number of high profile scandals involving money laundering, stolen property, and shady self-dealing. There is, for instance, the so-called “Bouvier Affair,” a legal dispute between the Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev and the Swiss “Freeport King” Yves Bouvier, the owner of an art shipping and storage empire, which is still unfolding in multiple international jurisdictions.The houses began aggressively hyping a never-ending flow of new inventory, and with it, a jet-set lifestyle.Like the doormen in Park Avenue co-op buildings, art shippers are frequently privy to the secrets of the extraordinarily rich. After meeting Rybolovlev in 2002, Bouvier offered to use his connections and insider knowledge to help him build a world-class collection by discreetly locating artworks and negotiating deals. In 2008, in the midst of a messy divorce and facing difficulties with the Russian government, Rybolovlev began pouring money into art with Bouvier’s assistance, shifting some of his wealth into portable assets. It later emerged that Bouvier had charged Rybolovlev multi-million dollar markups on his purchases. In one particularly egregious example, Bouvier charged Rybolovlev $118 million for Modigliani’s 1916 painting Nu couché au coussin bleu, but had acquired it for only $93.5 million. Rybolovlev accused Bouvier of fraud; Bouvier insisted, as Adam puts it, that “he was acting as a dealer, that this was clear to both sides, and that he was entitled to make what he could.”Yet the most troubling examples of the exploitation of art for financial gain are perfectly legal. As Adam outlines, collectors and their agents have continually found creative ways to use their art holdings to defer paying taxes, including the establishment of private museums and foundations, storing artworks in offshore freeports where they can be exchanged without incurring customs duties or VAT, and loopholes in the tax code such as “like-kind” exchanges. Originally set up in the 1920s to aid farmers by enabling them to defer taxes on livestock trades, “like-kind exchanges” are now regularly invoked by art collectors in order to avoid paying taxes on the sale of artworks: So long as a collector uses the proceeds of the sale of one work to purchase another within 180 days, the tax obligation can be perpetually kicked down the road.Adam brings both an insider’s perspective and a well-sourced reporter’s eye to Dark Side of the Boom, using legal documents, auction records, and firsthand interviews with art-world players to shed light on the seemingly inscrutable workings of the art market and the various tertiary industries—art advisors, investment funds, collection management software, storage, shipping, insurance—that have opportunistically sprung up around it. She opens chapters with scene-setting anecdotes—the unveiling of a freeport in Luxembourg, a lavish party celebrating a new Shanghai art fair—offering a privileged, behind-the-scenes view into the places where art’s value is produced and maintained.But while Adam paints a detailed and convincingly dire picture of the art world’s excesses, she never fully probes its implications. Perhaps ironically, its central weakness is her narrow focus on the activities of the art market itself: Her book largely brackets an exploration of the art market from the broader context of rising income inequality, economic exploitation, and staggering concentrations of wealth in the hands of the very few, all of which have enabled activity at the its upper reaches to continue unabated despite global downturns in other financial sectors. According to the sociologist Olav Velthuis, the art market ultimately benefits from an unequal distribution of wealth, as newly minted billionaires turn to blockbuster art purchases as a means of announcing their arrival.Moreover, the question of where the money comes from and where it ultimately goes is only a passing concern here. It’s no coincidence that the world’s most prominent art collectors include Walmart heiress Alice Walton; the Sackler family; Poju Zabludowicz, whose family fortune has its origins in arms dealing; and hedge fund founder Daniel Och, whose firm paid millions of dollars in bribes to government officials in several African countries in exchange for mining rights. No doubt they’d rather be remembered for their patronage of the arts than for profiteering off human misery.",How Modern Art Serves the Rich

TechCrunch first reported back in November Facebook internally building a prototype of the Messenger Broadcast tool that let companies blast a message to anyone who’s already started a conversation with them. Now Facebook is starting to test the Messenger Broadcast Composer externally, beginning with a small percentage of Pages in the U.S., Mexico and Thailand.Currently, the tool is free to use, but a Messenger spokesperson tells me that’s for a limited time only, and that eventually this will probably become a paid product that charges businesses. Messenger is capping the number of messages businesses can broadcast to deter spam, and won’t let them ping anyone who hasn’t voluntarily talked to them first. But some users still might find it interruptive, especially if less tech-savvy local merchants blast out low-quality promotions.Now with 1.3 billion users, Facebook is eager to monetize Messenger. And some use cases like being able to asynchronously text a customer support rep instead of waiting on hold on the phone make perfect sense for Messenger. But with display ads injected into the inbox, sponsored message ads from big brands and now Messenger Broadcasts, Facebook risks its chat app becoming our new spam folder.Using the Messenger Broadcast Composer, small businesses with no coding skills can choose a subset of people who’ve messaged them to hit with a text blast. They write up a title and body text, add an image and select a call to action, like a button people can hit to visit their website or a choice of pre-written replies.This screenshot of the old Messenger Broadcast prototype shows that for now it’s free to use, but Facebook says it will likely charge in the futureBusinesses can then do a basic segmentation of their potential recipients by manually labeling conversations with tags like “interested in shoes” and then sending the message to all threads with that label. After the free trial, Facebook likely will charge depending on how big of an audience a business wants to hit with a sponsored message. The original prototype noted that businesses could ping a few users for free, with the implication that they would be able to pay for more reach.Facebook tells me that people are increasingly messaging small businesses on its platform, often when they seek store or product information, or need customer service. In 2017, 330 million people started conversations with small businesses. “But we got feedback from small businesses that they don’t have the know-how or the tech resources to build experiences on the Messenger Platform (bots) that would enable them to reach their entire audience,” a Facebook spokesperson tells me.“This is why we are testing the broadcast composer; using this tool, small business Pages can message all or a segment of the people who have initiated conversations with their business at once, directly from their Pages Inbox,” says the spokesperson.Both Facebook’s News Feed ads and Snapchat’s business grew significantly when they added self-serve ad-buying interfaces. While there are plenty of big brands paying for huge campaigns through ads APIs or account reps, small businesses around the world can greatly benefit from self-serve ads that leverage their more familiar connection with customers. Sponsored messages from Nike or Walmart might immediately seem like spam. But from the shop around the corner, ads could feel more at home within Messenger if they keep it casual and conversational.",Facebook’s next money-maker: Messenger Broadcasts

But this time, instead of doing just one thing, the Light Phone 2 does a few, and exists somewhere between the original Light and your overwrought iPhone – though still far closer to the first-generation Light phone overall.The new design features a matte finish e-ink display, which occupies most fo the front face of the device and can show text, act as a virtual keyboard for sending messages, show your contacts and alarms and more. The phone uses Light’s own proprietary operating system, which is heavy on the text and limited on the total number of options and features, and you use physical keys on the side of the phone to navigate through menu options.The Light Phone 2 has 4G LTE connectivity and, since it’s not yet finalized but is instead kicking off its Indiegogo crowdsourcing campaign, could add features including directions, ride-sharing specific apps, playlists, weather reports, and voice commands according to the company’s founders, on top of the basic call, messaging, contact book, alarm and auto-reply features that are definitely going in. Whether those other add-on features make the cut will depend in some part on backer feedback.But with those potential additions, plus the larger, device-commanding active display, the Light Phone 2 is starting to sound a lot more smartphone-y and a lot less “Just a phone.” But LIght’s creators say that it’s definitely not, under any circumstances, going to add social media, advertising, email or news features to the phone.Really, those are the things that truly turn our mobile companions into huge time sucks and mood altering devices. Light Phone 2 is definitely more of a compromise than a purist dumbphone like the original, but it still also sounds like it fits the company’s chosen tagline of being “a phone for humans” better than your average flagship smartphone does today.Light’s been out of stock of its current generation device for a while now, which was probably because it was looking forward to this launch. The phone’s Indiegogo campaign has $225 as the early bird price for the device, with $400 as the target retail cost, and estimated shipping is April of next year (yes, over a year away) so the company also seems to have learned a lesson or two about manufacturing and shipping hardware, and is giving itself ample buffer for this redesign.Nokia is relaunching its ‘Matrix’ slider phone and other high-concept simple phones like the Punkt MP01 are out there trying to wean people away from their smartphone habits. It’s an appealing dream, but it’s hard to tell if it’s just a brief hiccup due to information ennui, or a real movement in the early offing.

9953,3923223,2018-03-01 14:00:33,"Uber launches Uber Health, a B2B ride-hailing platform for healthcare0Uber’s launching a new business line called Uber Health on Thursday that will provide a ride-hailing platform available specifically to healthcare providers, letting clinics, hospitals, rehab centers and more easily assign rides for their patients and clients from a centralized dashboard – without requiring that the rider even have the Uber app, or a smartphone.The Uber Health value proposition is similar to that of UberCENTRAL, the company’s ride-booking service aimed at business customers who want to provide rides for their clientele, but it’s also tailored for the healthcare industry with HIPAA standards compliance, as well as the ability to use the service on the client-side from even just a landline.Uber Health’s creation was rooted in some alarming statistics about patient care and healthcare client absentee rates. Uber Health General Manager Chris Weber explained on a call that some 3.6 million Americans miss medical appointments owing to a lack of available, reliable transportation. Plus, he noted that nearly a third of patients fail to show up to medical appointments every year in total.“Uber’s endeavors into health care trace back to 2014, when Uber first offered on-demand flu shots in large markets across the U.S.,” he said, regarding the genesis of the focus on health within Uber. “Since then there have been similar efforts throughout the world, from diabetes and thyroid testing in India, to subsidized rides for breast cancer screening in the U.S., to many more. That said, all of these efforts have been pop-ups.”Layout1PORTLAND_WOSINSKA_1016Riders 2Phone + DesktopWeber notes that this led them to investigate how they might do something more permanent, lasting and impactful in the healthcare space, and building on the reliability and efficiency of their consumer service, they thought they might be able to have an impact in terms of reducing that number of missed appointments.Uber Health is designed to do that, by allowing clinics and other medical facilities to book rides on their clients’ behalf, using a simple web dashboard where you input the client name, number and pick-up and top-off location, then select from Uber’s range of ride hailing vehicle type options. The client then receives a text message on their device alerting them that the company or organization has booked an Uber ride for them, along with a terms of service link, and then you get a notice of wo will be picking you up and when, with a contact number and a link to a live, web-based map showing you where they are and where they’re picking you up.As mentioned, Uber is also working on making patients aware of this information via voice call, which will work with both basic feature phones and landlines, and there’s a printout that clinic and facility staff can fill and provide to the client when they’re leaving their site and going home, too.Uber Health stores all of the trip information but only in client-side, HIPAA-compliant servers, and that data is never stored on Uber’s own, Weber points out. The ability to view and export the records is key for the organizations in terms of billing and reporting, and provides basic patient info (name and number) along with trip star and end point data.As for the business model, Uber Heatlh charges its healthcare organization customers only for the cost of individual rides, which are at par with what those rides would cost via the consumer app. Access to the dashboard and the reporting tools are included free. Uber already has over 100 healthcare organizations on the platform, thanks to a private beta that began last summer. The company also created an API to make it easy for those organizations to build the service into their existing patient management software.Uber Health is not a replacement for emergency service vehicles including ambulances, despite recent attention paid to instances where patients have hailed Ubers while in need of urgent care because they’re quicker to respond than ambulances in some cases. But it is a way that Uber can open up a promising new line of business while also providing a solution to a problem in the healthcare industry backed by the reliability of the ride-hailing company’s consumer service.","Uber launches Uber Health, a B2B ride-hailing platform for healthcare"

And while it’s not saying anything about valuation, a source close to DoorDash told us that the new funding values the company at $1.4 billion (post-money).Asked whether that level of funding means that DoorDash is starting to think about an IPO, CEO Tony Xu said, “It doesn’t really change anything for us. Instead, we’re saying it adds more flexibility, giving us the optionality in terms of where we want to invest and how we want to think about financing for the company.”Latest Crunch ReportThe round was led by SoftBank Group, with participation from Sequoia Capital, GIC and Wellcome Trust. SoftBank’s Jeffrey Housenbold and GIC’s Jeremy Kranz are joining Sequoia’s Alfred Lin and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers’ John Doerr on the company’s board of directors.“DoorDash’s technology advantages, exceptional management team and relentless merchant focus are reflected in their stunning growth and impressive unit economics,” Housenbold said in the funding announcement. “Food delivery is just the first chapter. Tony and team have a bold vision to create the world’s best logistics company, and we’re thrilled to partner with them to help accelerate their progress.”The company says it’s now working with almost 90 percent of the top 100 restaurant brands in the U.S., including Wendy’s, IHOP, and The Cheesecake Factory.Perhaps even more impressive: Xu said the company became “contribution margin positive” in the last year, which means that it’s profitable on a per-order basis. In fact, DoorDash has become profitable in its earliest markets.CrunchbaseOverviewDoorDash is a technology company that connects customers with their favorite local and national businesses in more than 600 cities across the United States and Canada.

We haven't managed any stunning low light shots yet, but we've not stress-tested it yet.There are some other impressive new flourishes in the camera from Samsung on the Galaxy S9 - for instance, the software works out when there’s an object or person in the foreground, and gives the background a slight blur, which is really appealing to the eye.Image 1 of 5Image 2 of 5Image 3 of 5Image 4 of 5Image 5 of 5Super Slo MoWe’ve played with this mode extensively on the Sony Xperia XZ Premium last year, and the version Samsung has brought out is technically identical to the one the Japanese brand produced.However, the software change of capturing slow motion when action is seen in the central square is interesting - we kept getting told to hold the phone steady when playing with the mode. We were doing it in darker conditions, and it’s clear that the Super Slo Mo mode is best used in bright lights, so we need to try that out.Here's a video taken late at night - the darker conditions, like with Sony, aren't great with the Super Slo Mo, but it's more designed for brighter scenes, which we'll play with more this week:AR EmojiOK, these are weird. We firstly thought that what we got looked nothing like us - and it’s annoying that the costumes on offer are a bit limiting. That said, the phone is good at getting the general idea of what you look like, and some of the automatic GIFs it generated are pretty funny and accurate (and they’ll freak your friends out, trust us).It’s really nice how Samsung has embedded the ability to use the AR Emoji throughout the phone - for instance, it’s already available as a sticker on WhatsApp that you can send to chums.The AR Emoji are interesting... but a little on the weird side.You can create little videos of yourself with your AR Emoji from the front-facing camera, but the sensor doesn’t seem super accurate, only picking up a few flickers of the face - it’s not something that you’d really want to share with friends (unless we find a bit more practice makes it more usable).The Galaxy S9 generates a lot of AR Emoji in different scenarios that you can use as GIFs to your pals, filling your gallery with them instantly. They’re fun, if a little strange. We’re not sure if this is going to be a massive feature or a novelty...Design and biometricsOK, there's barely anything new in the design on the S9... this is just the Samsung Galaxy S8 with a fingerprint scanner in a different place.The look and feel is identical - if you owned both phones then you’d easily pick up the wrong one time and again, and probably not notice which you had until you found it hard to unlock.What is nice is that the biometric security already seems way better than the Galaxy S8 - Intelligent Scan is so much more rapid than the iris / face scan, and you can also have the fingerprint scanner running at the same time.There were multiple occasions when the scanner fired up and were in before even realizing what had happened. It doesn’t work very well when placed down on the desk, but it’s still a big step up from last year.The dual speakers are also really nifty - so much louder than last year and offer a wider, more expansive sound. We’re still working out how best to test the Dolby Atmos abilities on the phone, but again, this is a small upgrade that looks like it’s making a big difference.MWC (Mobile World Congress) is the world's largest exhibition for the mobile industry, stuffed full of the newest phones, tablets, wearables and more.

It was filmed by Israeli publication Ynet, which posted a video of the device.Ynet has confirmed that the LG G7 is powered by Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 845 chip and includes 64GB of onboard storage with 4GB of RAM. A second, higher-end version of the handset will offer double the storage at 128GB and include 6GB of RAM.LG has upped the ante in terms of design, too: the vertical rear dual-camera setup is centered, with a fingerprint sensor below it. The 6-inch OLED display features an iPhone X-like notch at the top with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio, making it slightly taller than the 18:9 displays on the previous LG G6 and V30.At certain times in the leaked video, the notch does disappear and seemingly become hidden in a black notification bar, suggesting users may be able to hide the notch if they're not fans of the controversial feature.Some questions remain as to whether this is actually the final LG G7 design, however, with VentureBeat reporter and prolific leaker Evan Blass suggesting in a tweet that this ""may be the device LG scrapped"".This is interesting.

In 2009, when Apple stopped manufacturing 17-inch laptops, we knew that the norm for laptop displays was going to continue shrinking as time went on. Fast forward to 2018, and all of the best laptops are between the 12-inch MacBook and the 15-inch Surface Book 2. However, the most popular variations are the many laptops between the 13 and 14-inch mark.At a time when our top laptop choice altogether is the Dell XPS 13 and even gaming laptops are beginning to adopt similarly compact form factors, the choice is clear... or is it? Despite the fact that the best 13-inch laptop is considered a flagship by its manufacturer, there are factions within the 13-inch laptop category that make buying one a more complicated process than initially meets the eye.Many of these laptops are distinguished from each other due to their operating systems, but there is also a wide breadth of different form factors to keep an eye on these days. Some of the best 13-inch laptops can convert into tablets while others are mainstays of the traditional laptop economy. Whichever you prefer, we’ve listed the best 13-inch laptops that we have personally reviewed over the last year or so, explicitly ranked in order of awesomeness.Its changes are subtle, and yet the Dell XPS 13 is still the best 13-inch laptop you can buy. On the high end, it now offers a 4K display, for a sharper picture across the board. But even if you can’t afford higher tier configurations, the beautiful design, lengthy battery life and even the SD card slot are still there – plus you’ve got a quad-core processor no matter what poison you pick. Better yet, the 13.3-inch display of the XPS 13 has been squeezed into a smaller frame, which explains Dell’s marketing line: ‘the world’s smallest 13-inch laptop.’ Now stew on that, as you admire the Dell XPS 13’s gorgeous, albeit more expensive, Alpine White finish.You wouldn’t expect a laptop made by one of the biggest names in PC gaming to be thinner and lighter than a MacBook Pro, and yet here we are. The Razer Blade Stealth – in its all-new gunmetal finish – boasts not only a gorgeous and practical aesthetic, what with its 400-nit display brightness and full-size USB 3.0 ports, but it also has a few tricks up its sleeves to make it perform faster. At long last, the 8th-generation Intel Kaby Lake Refresh have made it into the newly 13.3-inch version of the Razer Blade Stealth. Though it received a ding on the battery life, an Ultrabook this fast is worth a 16-minute shorter use time on a single charge.There’s a new entry to Asus’s Zenbook lineup with the UX360, featuring a lot of the same specs as its predecessor but with the flexibility of a 2-in-1 laptop. While the ability to bend over backwards may diminish the build quality somewhat, it allows for new levels of functionality for computer consumers who want a laptop and tablet all in one. Thanks to an all-day battery, the Zenbook Flip UX360 really can go with you for everything you do. And, with a wide variety of internal customization, you can deck out the Zenbook Flip UX360 for your own personal needs, saving you some cash or boosting its performance.For those who prefer premium quality parts over exceptional affordability, the HP Spectre x360 contains everything you could ever ask for from a 2-in-1 without compromise. Weighing only 2.78 pounds (1.26kg) and measuring just over half an inch thick, it’s as light as it is thin. Plus, with up to a 4K screen and 8th-generation Intel processors paired with integrated UHD graphics, it’s one of the best ways to experience high quality video streaming as well as 720p gaming on a hybrid. That goes without mentioning the ports, of which there are plenty. You’ll get two USB-C Thunderbolt 3 connections in addition to USB 3.1 Type-A, a welcome variety to say the least.Samsung may not have made much of a dent in the laptop scene with much more than its Tab Pro S convertible, but Samsung's follow-up to the 2012 Series 9 notebook doesn’t just feature impressive specs – it’s got a competitive price as well. Marketed as an Ultrabook, it's certainly disheartening to know the battery life lasts only five hours, but given its sleek and sexy design, it almost doesn't matter. What's more, with the Samsung Notebook 9, you won't have to deal with the bloatware that makes many other Microsoft the target of angry forum posts.Everyone hates change. However, while the 15.6-inch frame of the Samsung Notebook 7 Spin we once knew will soon be erased from our memories forever, the new 13.3-inch model doesn’t seem like a terrible upgrade. It’s bounced two generations into the future in terms of processing power, and although there are no discrete graphics present, we’re glad to see a keyboard that can compete with some of the heavier hitters. It’s nothing revolutionary, yet as far as hybrid notebooks go, this one ain’t too shabby (plus it’s cheaper than a weaker MacBook Pro).The Surface Laptop is Microsoft’s first stab at a 'traditional' laptop, if you can even call it that knowing full well that its PixelSense touchscreen and Alcantara keyboard are anything but conventional. Featuring a full stack of U-series 7th generation Intel Core i processors, the Surface Laptop beats out Apple’s 12-inch MacBook any day of the week, and for a lower starting price at that. Despite the ports and operating system being limited, the Surface Laptop is appealing for its laudable design, beautifully vivid screen and impressive performance.As 2-in-1 laptops have become more prevalent in recent years, their manufacturers have been improving them at a nigh-equal pace. This rings true for few laptop makers more than it does for Lenovo, however, who has taken the liberty of crafting drop-dead gorgeous convertibles with standout watch band-like hinges, much like that of the Yoga 920. This rendition of Lenovo’s increasingly popular brand of hybrids sees the integration of USB-C ports, a centered webcam and, perhaps more interestingly, an 8th-generation Intel quad-core processor regardless of which configuration you opt for. It does purr more loudly than expected, and tablet mode could use some work, but the Lenovo Yoga 920 is ultimately worth its price of admission.In a market densely populated with slim-line laptops from a massive range of manufacturers, Apple's MacBook Air fights on admirably – though it started showing its age on the outside a long time ago. It has Intel's fifth-generation Core-series processors rather than the newest Skylake variants, but it's still a capable machine; even more so since Apple made 8GB of RAM standard across the line.The latest iteration of Apple’s seminal MacBook Pro series is here, and as you would expect it makes a number of notable improvements over last year’s offering. While it might not exactly feature the strongest battery life in the game (scoring under an hour less than last year’s offering), it does offer increased performance by way of a new CPU and faster RAM. Add that to Apple’s continued dedication to simplicity and beautiful design and you have a laptop that is sleek, portable and reliable.",The best 13-inch laptop 2018: the top 13-inch laptops we've reviewed

Ever since I got sent the DEEBOT N79S, a cheap robot vacuum cleaner made by Chinese manufacturer Ecovacs, I’ve been taking note of the similarities and differences – ending up with more of the former than the latter. Unfortunately the robot leaves my cat eating its dust.It reminds me to clean up things it can potentially choke on, but in a polite wayLast week I caught my cat in the act of eating a piece of string. He got quite far, about halfway through the two meters he’d pulled off a curtain. I was able to gently extract it, avoiding a poopy strand dangling out of his ass for days.My new DEEBOT handled a similar piece of string very differently. Instead of eating the whole thing, it stopped its rotating suck hole and started politely beeping at me to come free it. Now I scan the room it’s about to clean for anything that could possibly choke it, and clean up. Unlike my cat, who’d just go ahead and eat the string, DEEBOT teaches me to be a better person.I have to provide it with nourishment, but can do so at my leisureEvery morning, the moment my alarm goes off, a hairy black and white face concurs loudly that it’s time to get up. The alarm I can snooze, the cat I can’t.The robot vacuum cleaner feeds itself though. When its battery is running low, it finds its charging base and returns safely to load up on that sweet, sweet, electricity.It makes me check on it when it makes unusual noises, without being manipulativeThe first time I had DEEBOT clean a room with stairs in it, I was terrified. Every time I’d hear it get near the stairs, I’d run up to make sure it didn’t tumble off them. It never did. Thanks to a drop detector, it can avoid throwing itself off steps or even furniture. I learnt this after a while and relaxed.My cat, on the other hand, has learnt to abuse this worry by blurting out an unusually disconcerting meow from somewhere upstairs whenever he feels like a head scratch.It eats things it’s not supposed to eat, but not my human foodMy cat loves human food. Also, glasses of water or chocolate milk I just got for myself. With my cat around, I can’t leave my food unattended. The robot ignores human food, but might eat a hairpin or two.It can be petted, without necessarily liking itAs far as I can tell, the DEEBOT doesn’t posess sensors that register petting, so it’s not bothered when I reach out to touch it while it whizzes by minding its own business. It’s comforting in its predictability. With my cat, I never know if he’s going to appreciate a nice stroke or bite me. DEEBOT also doesn’t have any teeth.There are even little games you can play in your mind while watching; where will it turn next, will it sweep that piece of dirt there into its aspiration cavity, or will it hit that chair leg?It forces me to move things it could break, but not foreverWe’ve all seen videos of asshole cats shoving things off tables on purpose. My cat enjoys chewing on my poor plants while looking me straight in the eye. His dickishness has already made me move things from somewhere where they look good, to somewhere he can’t reach. Or I can see.DEEBOT also requires this, but in a way more subtle way. He just loves getting stuck in curtains, rugs, and under certain chairs. This means I have to move those, but only when it’s doing its work. Not all the time. And not to places where they’re permanently out of site.I have to clean its litter container, but can do it when I wantFor whatever reason, my cat loves taking a stinky dump the moment I’ve sat down for dinner. It might be because I normally go to the bathroom after I’ve fed him in the morning, and he’s just returning the favor. Anyway, after he’s done scooping litter onto his gift, I have to clean out his poop.The DEEBOT also needs me to clean the box where it deposits its litter, but allows me to do it at my leisure, and without spoiling my appetite.It can be left alone, and be civil about itLike a cat, the robot vacuum cleaner is comfortable being alone for a while. I can even set it to automatically clean at certain times on certain days. Unlike a cat, it doesn’t do other things like turning the couch into a hair repository or find out tea bags make for great toys, especially if you scatter its content all over the floor.It endears, but not in a fuzzy wayThe DEEBOT’s dumb persistance works endearingly, like watching a baby animal flail around. My girlfriend even gave it a name: Dinand, after the lead singer of Kane, our local Dutch version of Nickelback.",10 ways my robot vacuum cleaner is a better version of my cat
9960,3923303,2018-03-02 10:31:24,"About TNWTNW SitesThe magic behind the EU’s most lit Twitter accountThe EU isn’t exactly known for its ability to relate to young people, being the massive and cumbersome governmental institution it is. That’s why I was pleasantly surprised when I came across this tweet the other day:I follow a lot of official EU social media accounts, but I had never seen any of them use pop culture GIFs like EU Trade does — the official Twitter account of the EU Commission’s International Trade Department. I started imagining that somewhere, deep down in the bureaucratic catacombs of the EU, there was a text filled with institution jargon outlining ‘cool’ ways to use Graphic Interchange Formats to reach the continent’s younger demographics.To find out more, I tracked down the person behind the EU Trade’s GIF and emoji usage, Ariel Delvecchio, who is one of the most adamant emoji/GIF evangelists within the EU.“I’ve been systematically promoting the use of emoji and GIFs since 2015 and when I started there was nobody else doing it,” explains Delvecchio.“GIF use is a conscious part of our communication strategy here at DG TRADE, and that’s just the latest incarnation of what we’ve been doing for the past three years. You could say that we have a tradition of being ahead of the institutional curve when it comes to digital communication — it started with a very engaging account of the EU TTIP Team, and continued with us being the first institutional account to systematically adopt the use of emoji in a communication strategy — probably the first governmental institutional account in the world. We’ve also been systematically using GIFs since 2016.”The first GIFs were much tamer and uninteresting, but it’s obvious that Delvecchio and his team have grown bolder lately and have started embracing GIFs with more pop culture references — like normal people use them.The two unofficial EU languages: Emoji and GIFsThe EU’s use of emoji and GIFs actually makes sense within the union’s broader vision. The EU is all about communicating in and translating between multiple languages, whether they’re traditional are not.“You can see emoji and GIFs as two extra languages,” says Delvecchio. “They’re perhaps not official but I’d like to argue that they’re equally important as the official languages. When you use emoji or GIFs, almost any person from any country — regardless of which languages the speak — can relate to it and understand that message.”This actually makes sense as most of us use visual ways to express ourselves every single day. Even my grandmother uses emoji, so why shouldn’t the EU? Especially when being fluent in these languages really pays off.Delvecchio has seen it clearly in the data that embracing emoji usage has pumped up engagement numbers considerably and that’s why the use of GIFs should be increased as well. GIFS and emoji don’t dilute the message at all, in fact, the opposite is true: They amplify it.“The tweets containing emoji — we have more reliable data on that than the GIFs — had up to six to eight percent engagement rates in 2015/16 and around four percent afterwards — contrasting that with the average for normal tweets being one percent. Interestingly, since then the engagement trend in emoji tweets is slowly getting lower, possibly due to a more widespread use of emoji and hence saturation from all sides by the followers.”GIF/emoji friendly account dwarfs othersBut if these visual ways of communicating are able to transcend borders and engage people more, does Delvecchio believe we’ve found the new Esperanto? A new universal language?“I believe that emoji/GIFs are not the new Esperanto, they are the old Esperanto, much older than writing itself. I see them as a technology-enabled digital form of the primordial visual language that doesn’t even require knowing a language to understand it because it’s already embedded in us — to a large extent. That’s where the true power of emoji, GIFs, and memes in general lies.”The Emoji (and GIF) Union and the final frontierTo my great dismay, I found out that the EU doesn’t in fact have official guidelines tucked away somewhere, detailing which emoji to use or what kind of GIFs are likely to reach millenials. However, Delvecchio did confirm that he and his team have some internal ones — and some other EU institution might as well — where they collect their knowledge on what type of tweets and emoji/GIF usage has proven to work.Unfortunately he couldn’t share the full guide with me — highly classified emoji business and all that — but Delvecchio says people at the EU are trying to be more open and forthcoming about their work as an institution and that emoji and GIF usage has helped them do it. But if there are any EU employees out there that want to leak emoji/GIF guidelines, you know where to find me.Delvecchio also hosts official workshops for other EU employees, being the evangelist he is, to get more people to push the envelope of institutional communication by pumping it full of emoji, GIFs, and hopefully someday, memes.“I’d definitely say that using memes at some point is one of our goals. We’re trying to get into it, but it’s not going to be easy as it’s a more sensitive issue. We mostly tweet about bilateral relations, like trade deals, so getting approval from all parties could be tricky,” says Delvecchio. Unfortunately he doesn’t have the support right now within EU but memes are definitely a part of his long term strategy.It’s understandable that it’s difficult to implement meme usage, as there’s definitely a fine line between ‘how do you do, fellow kids’ and a ‘sick meme game.’ So we might need to wait a few years before seeing a fresh meme dump from an EU institution.However, before crossing the final meme frontier, the GIF usage needs to be perfected, but could it be that the EU itself would stop that from happening? I asked whether the EU’s current rigorous copyright reform — which people are already worried about — might restrict the usage of pop culture GIFs, like Delvecchio’s beloved Disney ones.“I only wish that there will be enough prudence to make sure we can keep on using these timeless GIFs — when it comes to meaning, archetypes, and symbolism, there’s little that surpasses the versatility of Disney GIFs.”Fortunately, there’s no way that it will effect emoji, which are still close to Delvecchio’s heart. He loves it every time new emoji are released but there’s one in particular that he feels needs an upgrade — that would be especially useful for accounts like the EU Trade — the handshake emoji. 🤝“I really like the handshake emoji because it symbolizes straightness and the handshake ‘seals the deal.’ But I wish that the handshake was designed a bit better, at least on Twitter. I think the hands should be a little bit bigger and made like they’re actually ‘coming together,’ instead of being this illegible little emoji blob,” Delvecchio explains.I personally am really glad that there’s somebody within the massive infrastructure of the EU fighting to make it a bit more human. It’s made up of people like us, so it should also relate to us. And if there’s one thing we’ve learned from our constant online presences is that all humans speak GIF and emoji.However, I’m also somewhat saddened by the EU’s humanity. I was really hoping to find a dreary legislation-like text determining what constituted as ‘lit’ or ‘woke’ GIFs and emoji. Maybe someday my bizarre dream of institution speak merged with internet culture will become a reality.","EU official: Emoji and GIFs aren't the new Esperanto, they're the old Esperanto"

Instagram previously added the ability to join Stories via video a few months ago, so perhaps we should have seen this coming.I’m not a fan of this trend of baking every possible functionality into apps just because you can do it – and with Instagram, it feels like it’s all too easy to mar the experience by tacking on too much stuff.I’m happy to broadcast my photos and video there knowing that my audience includes a mix of friends, acquaintances, and strangers who enjoy my posts – meaning that I’m comfortable with the persona I put out there, and with the way I interact with people in the app.I also like using the messaging features to share visual content with a small bunch of friends and groups that have come together to share our common love for things like watches.However, I certainly don’t want people to call me on the app I use for when I want to simply kill time, or when I’m looking for recipes, or looking for gift ideas.

As these useful technologies gain steam in the workplace, businesses everywhere will have to adapt their processes or risk falling behind.To help leaders prepare for the growing presence of AI and automation in the business world, we asked a panel of Young Entrepreneur Council (YEC) members to answer the following question:The AI/automation revolution is here. How can companies keep up?Their best answers are below:1. Get an internal expert onboard.Make sure you have internal expertise. Hiring consultants to ‘check the box’ normally results in overpaying for under delivery. Understanding how to properly apply artificial intelligence and machine learning to your business is just as important as the implementation. – Hongwei Liu, mappedin2. Turn to AI to improve your security.While once upon a time we made a choice to move forward, innovation and advancement are now crucial to survival. One of the most popular ways companies can use AI technology is to fight fraud and financial crime. Criminals have elevated their game in today’s digital world, but AI-powered solutions are able to help businesses protect themselves against sophisticated fraud schemes and cyber crimes. – Stephen Ufford, Trulioo3. Use chatbots for customer service.AI-powered chatbots promise intelligent digital assistants that are available 24/7 to resolve your customer requests affordably, consistently and very quickly. Companies can use predefined rules in a decision tree to understand and solve customer queries. Eventually, they can apply machine learning to learn from each interaction and escalate more complex issues to human agents. – Raad Ahmed, LawTrades4. Research and read.Pay attention to what is going on by subscribing to sites that provide AI industry research, analysis and updates. This information is critical to know what is going on and when and where to get involved. – Angela Ruth, Calendar5. Foster an environment of entrepreneurship and creativity.One thing AI and automation are unable to replace is the value of a strong business relationship. Particularly in the startup world, many businesses can live or die by the partners they make along the way. As long as business leaders can maintain top-notch instincts and encourage and foster an environment of entrepreneurship and creativity, they can stay one step ahead of AI. – Zohar Steinberg, token payments6. Understand how AI can be applied to your industry.Start by understanding AI’s application specific to your industry. Then make sure you have a business problem that needs to be solved. AI is just a tool to solve that problem. Applying or partnering with companies that can more efficiently solve that problem with AI is how you keep up. If the right partner doesn’t exist, you can design and build an AI solution. – George White, Pavia Systems7. Start small.Start by finding ways automation can work for your business on a small scale. You can begin with automated website chats or save time by automating parts of your workflow. We use an application that automatically reminds us when to follow-up on tasks so we don’t have to continually scan to-do lists. Then, we use the time we’ve saved to work on new products and innovative marketing strategies. – Jessica Gonzalez, InCharged8. Learn from others’ mistakes.AI is an extremely powerful tool that is only becoming more powerful over time, but there have been several speed bumps on this road. Learn from the mistakes made by others. Microsoft had to drastically revamp their AI chatbot after a very public debacle, as did Tesla after unintentionally causing a fatality with a self-driving car. – Bryce Welker, CPA Exam Guy9. Augment, rather than fully automate.AI and machine learning technology is still in its infancy. I don’t suggest creating automated call centers or leaving your PPC campaign to a robot if you’re a small business. I say augment; don’t automate. Identify weak points in your organization, from the marketing department to finances, where AI-powered technology can augment and improve the existing workflow. – Kristopher Jones, LSEO.com10. Use your imagination.It’s not so much AI/ML technology itself that is preventing more widespread adoption, but rather slow implementation and a lack of imagination from business leaders. Don’t get left behind. Think hard about how AI/ML can transform the way you do business, researching the best tools out there that would help automate processes and reduce operational costs, depending on your business. – Thomas Smale, FE InternationalThis post is part of our contributor series.

After detecting the attack, it requested helped from Akamai Prolexic, a service that mitigates such incidents by routing traffic through its larger network and also blocking malicious requests. The company told Wired that it had never handled that much traffic all at once – but because it had designed its infrastructure to handle five times the traffic from the previous largest attack recorded, Akamai managed to bring GitHub back online in just a few minutes.Interestingly, no botnets were involved in this attack, as is usually the case with DDoS incidents. Instead, the hackers went with what’s known as an amplification attack. They spoofed GitHub’s IP address, and sent queries to several memcached servers that are typically used to speed up database-driven sites. The servers then amplified the returned the data from those requests to GitHub – only, amplified by 50 times.It’s good to know that even with this much traffic, the attackers couldn’t do much harm besides interrupting GitHub’s service for a few minutes.

In a blog post, Facebook’s head of News Feed, Adam Mosseri, said the experiment was motivated by “consistent feedback” that people wanted to see more from friends and family and less from media organizations and businesses.The change, predictably, didn’t go over so well in the six countries Facebook used as a testing ground: Bolivia, Cambodia, Guatemala, Serbia, Slovakia, and Sri Lanka. Aside from the backlash by news organizations, Facebook found that separating the feeds didn’t actually lead to increased connections with friends and family as it had intended. Although this could also be blamed on how the company chose to roll out the change.Without warning, Facebook made a substantial change to the News Feed. And according to some users in the test markets, few had any idea what had happened to their News Feed, or how to best utilize Explore.Today though, Mosseiri had this to say about the failed experiment:To understand if people might like two separate feeds, we started a test in October 2017 in six countries.You gave us our answer: People don’t want two separate feeds. In surveys, people told us they were less satisfied with the posts they were seeing, and having two separate feeds didn’t actually help them connect more with friends and family.To be clear, this in no way impacts changes to the News Feed announced last month. In January, Facebook announced it was prioritizing “meaningful social interactions,” a move that would feature more posts from friends and family, and fewer updates from media organizations and business.","Facebook pumps the brakes on its secondary News Feed, 'Explore'"
9966,3923309,2018-03-02 02:07:09,"About TNWTNW SitesFacebook’s ad policies are infuriatingly sexistFacebook is again under fire over policies meant to curb adult content in ads. The company has recently faced scrutiny for scattershot enforcement of its own rules, seemingly penalizing women for showing skin that men get away with.Several people reported to the New York Times that they’d had pictures taken down or rejected from ad campaigns for featuring female nudity, despite the fact that much more explicit photos of men have remained up.Facebook’s policy on adult content in ads states that it prohibits:Nudity or implied nudity, even if artistic or educational in nature, except for statuesExcessive visible skin or cleavage, even if not explicitly sexual in natureImages focused on individual body parts, such as abs, buttocks or chest, even if not explicitly sexual in natureContent portraying excessive nudity or alluding to sexual activityFacebook has five examples of non-compliant ads on its page. Four of those have women as the primary subjects — the fifth has two people of ambiguous gender in bed together. While it could be argued that two of them might be inappropriate — a woman in bed, maybe; a woman miming a blowjob, sure — the explicit prohibition against artistic implied nudity and cleavage feel backwards.Facebook doesn’t say why it prohibits cleavage, and it seems like nothing more than a low blow aimed at women. Infuriatingly, one picture shows a woman leaning forward slightly and looking into the camera. This image apparently “shows someone in a sexually suggestive pose.” Really, that’s apparently all it takes, even though she looks more like she’s modeling for hair conditioner.It’s fairly common for women to be accused of being flirty in situations that, to their minds, are perfectly innocent. It’s the reason men like VP Mike Pence say they won’t be alone with a woman they aren’t married to under any circumstances, because no matter how professional or banal the setting, they seemingly believe women are seductive temptresses.It’s reductive; it’s insulting; it’s not the least bit flattering; and the knowledge that our bodies are unwelcome or being watched is really damned uncomfortable. So when Facebook says a woman is sexually suggestive for possessing cleavage and a haughty stare, it doesn’t help one bit.At best, Facebook enforces the rules unevenly.Recently, Facebook removed a picture of the curvaceous Venus of Willendorf statue, despite their ad policies explicitly making an exception for statues (but not other forms of art — Michelangelo’s canon must really confuse them). Facebook later reversed the decision, saying the ad the picture was in “should have been approved.”On the flip side, when the NYT asked Facebook about a specific ad of a man’s rippling obliques posted on a romance novel page, a Facebook spokesperson said it shouldn’t have been approved. To reiterate, Facebook’s ad policy prohibits “Images focused on individual body parts, such as abs, buttocks or chest, even if not explicitly sexual in nature.”So while Facebook might claim its policies are in place to prevent any inappropriate material getting through, it seems fairly obvious it’s more focused on women in ads over men.The Next Web’s 2018 conference is just a few months away, and it’ll be💥💥.

9967,3923310,2018-03-01 22:53:33,"About TNWTNW SitesResearch shows when your Apple product is likely to bite the dustIf you want to know how much life you’ll get out of your new Apple product, an analyst for Asymco has estimated the average life of your next device.Researcher Horace Dedlu determined lifespan by using the number of active devices and the cumulative total of products sold. The former number, revealed during Apple’s Q1 financial call last month, has only been disclosed once before.When you subtract the number of active devices from the total number sold, the remaining number is the amount of products that have been retired in a quarter. Dedlu contends that figuring the average lifespan is as easy as calculating when the number of devices sold at one time equals the number of devices that have been retired at a later time.To use his own results as an example, the number of products sold in Q3 2013 equals the number of products retired in Q4 2017 — and from that you can infer that was the moment the 2013 devices died and their owners went out to buy new ones.Based on these factors, Dedlu puts the average lifespan of an Apple device at just over 4 years. That number has also increased over time. In an earlier article on Asymco, Dedlu estimated that two out of every three Apple devices were still in use at any given time.Almost all of Apple’s toys were included in this data, including the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac. I’d be eager to see breakdowns for each individual product, as the lifespan of a Mac is probably different from that of an Apple Watch.TNW 2018 is coming soon, and we want to see you there.

9968,3926086,2018-03-02 09:15:34,"Machine learning enthusiast, I spend my time reading scientific papers, replicating work and waiting for my own creativity to kick in!Mar 2OpenMined logoContributing to OpenMinedSumming up 3 months with the communityIf you are new to the OpenMined community, this article provides an overview of the current situation. I hope it will help you see more clearly the purpose and challenges of the community so you don’t get overwhelmed by the project complexity👍🏻As OpenMined is evolving fast, the date of the publication of this article is very important — March 01, 2018.TL;DR:OpenMined is a very ambitious community, building OpenSource tools to ease the developments of applications leveraging machine learning on private/confidential data, automatically complying with legal restriction thanks to cryptography and automatically remunerating data/compute/expertise contributors thanks to cryptocurrencies.What is OpenMined?OpenMined is a project that has been started 8 months ago by 👉🏻 Trask 👈🏻 when he made the observation that no OpenSource tools existed to do private ML. From this simple observation to its current state, the OpenMined community had to face a mountain of technical challenges which gave birth to the current incredibly ambitious project.Many developers are contributing every day on the different repositories, Hell many repositories have been created and/or deprecated in the last 3 months! It’s been pretty wild and that’s amazing, it shows how lively the project is!What are we trying to do?OpenMined is currently concerned with 3 problems surrounding artificial intelligence:How to deal with sensitive/confidential data?How to deal with the explosion of the computational need to train Machine learning models?How to handle remuneration for any contribution would it be data, computation or expertise?Those 3 concerns are at the heart of OpenMined and shaped the project to its current form one after the other. The community realised pretty fast that a project lacking any of those 3 pillars would not fit the bill and not be ambitious enough to support the overall vision:Building OpenSource tools to ease the creation and training of machine learning pipeline for private/confidential data while automatically remunerate the different contributors.Think about it, companies and researchers will soon face a lot more regulation from governments (we can already see many initiatives like #GDPR and growing concerns in general about AI) and this will hinder their capacity to innovate if they don’t have the right tool to strive in the upcoming new regulatory space.3 problems, 3 solutionsThose 3 problems can be solved with 3 overall solutions:Encryption: which allows one to securely keep models and data private against malicious actorsFederated learning: which allows one to train computationally greedy machine learning models in a decentralised manner on less computationally efficient devices.Gradient marketplace: which allows one to be remunerated for its contribution to the training process.Each one of those 3 pillars support the whole ecosystem in its own way by giving OpenMined the opportunity to create a self-reinforcing positive loop:The encryption is beneficial to the whole ecosystem, it works as an insurance for the data providers and the model owner in a decentralised and anonymous environments. Also it alleviates the concerns one might have about sharing confidential information.Federated learning provide model owners without enough computational power and/or enough data the access to a decentralised cluster of computational nodes and data provider to train their model.The gradient marketplace creates financial incentives for data owners, expertise holders and computation providers to contribute to a training pipeline.3 solutions, dozens of possible technical implementationsThe exciting part of those 3 pillars is that they are actually 3 whole research fields. One could see that as a burden but we don’t. It would be legitimate to ask why on earth one would try to merge 3 research fields and their respective state of the art solutions instead of going for proven and solid existing ones.The answer is pretty simple, Machine learning itself is a field of research where many parts still need to be understood. Good luck finding proven engineering solutions that scale on this field when you start to add constraint like privacy on it.This is why OpenMined is still in an exploration phases for the underlying technology that will power the ecosystem. And yet, this is exactly what makes OpenMined valuable as all those research fields have made some very interesting advances in the last few years. Maybe it’s time to merge all those advances don’t you think?Let me point you at some articles that are valuable to get familiar with the different subjects:Federated learning: OpenMined is currently investigating IPFS and their pub sub features to build its own federated grid. To get a good overview of federated learning, I invite you to read this Google blog post.Gradient marketplace: OpenMined is currently investigating ways to incorporate a friendly and powerful remuneration scheme. This is one of the most unique and interesting parts of OpenMined. Let me detail it for you.A gradient marketplace for everyoneAll kinds of machine learning practitioners should have an interest in OpenMined, actually even non-practitioner (like non-ML companies sponsoring Kaggle competitions).Every technology used by OpenMined is there to power this “Gradient marketplace”. It is at the same time, the core of the decentralised training process and the accessible part for end-users. It is gluing together all our technology: IPFS, Blockchain, MPC, Trillian, Unity, etc.As a high level abstraction we have 4 different profiles that will interact in the marketplace:Computation providers: They provide computation power (but only for the case of public model and public data, more on this below👇🏻)Nothing prevents some overlapping on those 4 categories, this is just the most generic case. Task sponsors and data scientists could belong to the same organisation, that would not make much of a difference.Let’s explore the process in more details now.First, task sponsors (startups, big Co., random individuals, etc.) needs a model and they have no expertise, no data, no computational capacities but they usually have a business incentive for the model. In that case, they provide a bounty to the network so the different other actors get interested in contributing. They must also provide a validation set so we can have an objective metric to compare contributions.Second, data scientists propose some models architectures (including training and initialisation process) that are linked to the task. All those architectures are now ready to compete for the bounty.Every data owners that have data compliant with the task can contribute to the training. 2 different possibilities here, either the data is public and data owners can just provide their data to the network. Or their data is private and in this case they download a model, train it on its on private data and upload back the updated model.Notice that in the private case, the data never leaves the data owner even if it’s encrypted. This is why computation providers cannot play a role in the private setting.Technically, this process creates a tree structure of models for which the root node is that task, the first layer of the tree is the model descriptions, all other layers are different level of trained models and leafs represent the last trained models.Occasionally, the task provider compute the validation accuracy on all existing leaves to check if a given threshold has been reached (could be a duration for the competition, an accuracy threshold, etc.)If the threshold has been reached, the “model winner” is declared and all contributors to the given “model winner” are remunerated:for data through improvement of the validation accuracyfor computation and RAM usage, billed per operationfor expertise by the numbers of model architectures proposed to a given problem.To do so we use micro-payments and cryptocurrencies. As a first step we will use an existing crypto-platform API to simplify the process and leverage existing ecosystem. In the long term, OpenMined will just work in a fully decentralised manner leveraging existing cryptocurrencies directly.All of this happens, if needed, in a fully encrypted manner assuring all the parties to be compliant with any privacy laws.Ease of use, a core valueWe’ve explored the 3 core technology of OpenMined but I would like to highlight one of its core values. Even in the most technical environment, ease of use is usually a deal breaker for potential users and I’m really amazed by how OpenMined try to keep the balance between the user experience and the technical challenges.Remember that the overall goal is to simplify the development process of private ML application. This simplicity is the bond that unifies the whole architecture: abstracting away all the complexity at every step of the development is a necessity for us.I could list all the efforts that have been made in the past in the different repositories, but that would mean very little. The important message I want to convey is that we want to give access to private machine learning to everyone, avoiding any too steep learning curves that would left non technical people out of the loop.The first and simple step is to be able to use the overall workflow designed for the gradient marketplace on the very simple case of one user holding the data and one user training a model. Consider this achieved!2. Federated learning: open grid for public models on public distributed datasets (on going)Implementing the first federated learning algorithm, everything is public for now. The focus is on handling all the technical details brought by asynchronous and decentralised machine learning pipelines (asynchronous SGD, delayed gradients, etc.). This is currently happening!3. Open grid for public models on private distributed datasets (soon)We add the cryptographic layer to the whole technological stack! As a first step on that side, we encrypt only the data, arguably the most important and crucial part of the machine learning training process on confidential data.4. Adding reputation and remunerationAs things start to get private, the question of trust starts to kick in. A reputation system (closely linked to the remuneration system) using the blockchain will be bootstrapped. The more you train/provide data/provide funds in an honest way on the network, the more reputation you get, the more nodes are willing to work with you!5. Open Grid for Private models on private dataThe final step of the cryptographic setting. Models get encrypted too, improving the incentive for data scientists and private companies to train their models on OpenMined.6. Backend API for private ML applicationsFinally, we can achieve the grand vision and build a set of plug-and-play API for many different contexts (games, web apps, mobile apps, etc.)7. Meet at your own local pub worldwide on live stream to celebrate the work done 🍻Arguably the most important step of the OpenMined community!To finish this piece of writing, I would like to highlight the fact that we keep facing technical challenges and open questions on the different possible implementations of the above technologies. We are currently investigating many papers on those subjects to help us go forwards but if you have any knowledge in those areas, please reach out to our slack!If you read so far, thank you for your attention. Hopes it was enlightening! Have a good day sir ☕️",Contributing to OpenMined

A study from MIT says most drivers are making less than minimum wage. Spencer Platt/Getty Images hide captiontoggle captionSpencer Platt/Getty ImagesAn Uber car waits for a client in Manhattan in June 2017. A study from MIT says most drivers are making less than minimum wage.Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesThe vast majority of Uber and Lyft drivers are earning less than minimum wage and almost a third of them are actually losing money by driving, according to researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.A working paper by Stephen M. Zoepf, Stella Chen, Paa Adu and Gonzalo Pozo at MIT's Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research says the median pretax profit earned from driving is $3.37 per hour after taking expenses into account. Seventy-four percent of drivers earn less than their state's minimum wage, the researchers say.The conclusions are based on surveys of more than 1,100 drivers who told researchers about their revenue, how many miles they drove and what type of car they used. The study's authors then combined that with typical costs associated with a certain car's insurance, maintenance, gas and depreciation, which was gathered in data from Edmunds, Kelly Blue Book and the Environmental Protection Agency.Drivers earning the median amount of revenue are getting $0.59 per mile driven, researchers say, but expenses work out to $0.30 per mile, meaning a driver makes a median profit of $0.29 for each mile.""While the paper is certainly attention grabbing, its methodology and findings are deeply flawed. We've reached out to the paper's authors to share our concerns and suggest ways we might work together to refine their approach.""The newspaper also noted, ""Other studies and surveys have found higher hourly earnings for Uber drivers, in part because there are numerous ways to report income and to calculate costs and time and miles spent on the job.""MIT authors also calculated that it's possible for billions of dollars in driver profits to be untaxed, because ""nearly half of drivers can declare a loss on their taxes."" Drivers are able to use the IRS standard mileage rate deduction to write off some of the costs of using a car for business. In 2016, that number was $0.54 per mile. ""Because of this deduction, most ride-hailing drivers are able to declare profits that are substantially lower,"" researchers write.""If drivers are fully able to capitalize on these losses for tax purposes, 73.5% of an estimated U.S. market $4.8B in annual ride-hailing driver profit is untaxed,"" they add.The MIT researchers said 80 percent of drivers said they work less than 40 hours per week. An NPR/Marist poll in January found 1 in 5 jobs in the U.S. is held by a contract worker; contractors often juggle multiple part-time jobs.Uber and Lyft both have ""notoriously high"" turnover rates among drivers. A report last year said just 4 percent of Uber drivers work for the company for at least a year.NPR's Aarti Shahani reported in December that Lyft began a program to give drivers ""access to discounted GED and college courses online"" in a recruiting effort.It was only last year that Uber introduced the option to tip drivers into its app for customers. Recode listed the initiatives Uber rolled out in 2017 in order to appeal to drivers, including 24-hour phone support, paid wait time and paying drivers if customers cancel after a certain amount of time.Both Uber and Lyft have been fighting legal battles for years against initiatives to classify their drivers as ""employees"" instead of ""independent contractors"" — meaning drivers don't receive benefits like health care or sick leave.","Uber, Lyft Drivers Earning A Median Profit Of $3.37 Per Hour, Study Says"
9970,3926327,2018-03-02 14:12:29,"About TNWTNW SitesHow Sweden’s startups became Europe’s digital vikingsSweden is an Eden-like country for tech startups and that’s no news.If you want to start an innovative business, the land of Nobel Prize, Volvo, and Ikea offers top-notch infrastructures, simple regulations, and a smart tax legislation.The corporate tax rate is as low as 22 percent yet income taxes are relatively high which makes Sweden doubly appealing for new business ventures. On the one hand, the government doesn’t cannibalize your company’s profits while, on the other, it has the financial resources to guarantee extensive welfare packages that constitute a much-needed safety-net for groundbreaking yet risky business ideas.In frozen Sweden, unicorns do find pastures to graze. Over the years, five Swedish startups reached the coveted $ 1 billion evaluation: Skype, Spotify, King, Mojang, and Klarna. The country has 20 startups every 20,000 employees — compared to five in the United States. Sweden is so crazy about startups and innovation that even the Church — usually not the most progressive club in a country —invested $ 5 million in the sector.For our series of Growth Stories, I’ve been interviewing many CEOs of fast-growing Swedish companies. Different hallmarks of this idyllic ecosystem struck me but one, in particular, stood out. All those startups products were at the end variations on the same business theme: make content valuable again.Spotify is possibly the most remarkable example. Since its inception in 2008, the company defibrillated a dying music industry implementing what has been branded as a “sustainable business model for artists.” Despite good intentions, the company got its fair share of criticism from people that didn’t feel the compensations were high enoughThe company always replied that its product massively migrates users away from piracy. In the Internet age — they claimed — Spotify represents the best of all possible worlds for musicians. Spotify is now almost worth $ 20 billion and filed to go public.On a relatively smaller scale, dozens of other companies set on the same mission. Acast, for example, is a hugely successful podcast platform that’s spearheading the field of voice-first technology. Soundtrack Your Brand is a b2b version of Spotify (yeah, it’s illegal to stream music from Spotify in your store). Epidemic Sound produces music for online creators. And these are only audio-related companies.Acast officeThen, there are the legions of game publishers. Colossi like King, Mojang, Paradox, and Mag Interactive gave the world viral hits such as Minecraft, the Candy Crush saga, and Ruzzle. When Steam announced its first Steam Awards in 2016, 11 out of the 100 awarded games were brewed in Sweden. An astounding stat, given the country’s dimensions and its number of game development studios.And finally, there’s “newstech,” a sector busy with finding a sustainable business model for journalism. Stockholm hosts at least nine notable startups that are trying to make the news easier to monetize.Epidemic Sound’s officeA couple of weeks ago, I was chatting with Magnus Hultman, a founder whose company Strossle falls under this latter category. After he repeated once again that its company’s mission is to make journalism pay again, I couldn’t help but ask if he knew why this is such a common trait in Swedish startups.“Oh, I know why,” he quipped. “It’s because this is the land of Piratebay!” The answer begged further clarifications. “We were the first to pirate music, films, and books. We were the digital vikings out there stealing content! Then, we realized that stealing is not a sustainable business model. If you just keep plundering, soon there’s nothing left. The loot is gone. So we needed to fix what we broke. That’s why Spotify got started. And that’s why thousands of years ago we became Christians, leaving our hideous viking helmets and swords behind.” Magnus concluded the explanation with a decisively not viking smile.Magnus HultmanAt first, I felt that sounded a bit too simplified and sales-y, just a good marketing tagline without much reality behind it. The somewhat essentialist approach almost reminded me of Montesquieu’s The Spirit of the Laws where the French philosopher paired climate and society, claiming that Nordic men were braver, more honest, and less suspicious towards others because of the cold they endured.But then I realized that maybe Magnus explanation might actually have some truth to it. The “digital vikings” hypothesis seemed a viable way to get a good grasp of Swedish tech ecosystem.Swedes might have left their helms and swords behind, as Magnus explained, but the colorful metaphor of the “digital vikings” was just too good to not be used to illustrate the Swedish tech ecosystem and some of its aspects that are usually overlooked.We then launched our quest to find the habits that make Sweden tech startups the great vanquishers of the digital era. Here they are.7 habits of highly effective digital VikingsStrossle’s office1. Find new pools of wealthIf you don’t own it, then just take it. That’s what vikings used to do. But after destruction, there was always construction. Vikings conquered Normandy but then they implemented a sophisticated social system. In the Middle Ages, the loot was made of gold and gemstones, nowadays it’s content that — 20 years after Bill Gates famous essay— is still king. The digital vikings startups have found new, legitimate ways to appropriate content (music, news, podcasts,…) and make it valuable again. They understood that all the big digital platforms (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix,…) are useless without it.2. Sail across the seaIt doesn’t matter that Sweden is one of the best country in the world to live in, for your business it will never be enough. Swedish companies are always built to go international soon or later. And this has always been the case. This long and established tradition is a valuable asset in the contemporary digital world where business ventures must have an international mindset from the beginning.3. Learn new habits from the lands you conquerThe digital vikings are great conquerors but they’re also eager to pick up new habits and trends from the lands they go ashore at. “When you live in a country that it’s often dark and cold, you get curious about the rest of the world,” says Magnus Hultman.Swedes always keep an ear to the ground, staying abreast of innovation. “We’re a society of early adopters,” adds Therése Gedda, founder and CEO of Swedish startup 30minMBA, “for this reason, Sweden is an excellent test market for b2c companies.”4. Crush the hierarchyThe digital vikings are not particularly fond of hierarchies. Only results and performance grant authority. And also in that case, the leadership style generally consists of entrusting people with freedom and responsibility. In a lowly populated country such as Sweden, you always lack good people and you can’t waste them on bureaucracy and tedious tasks.“Flat hierarchies are a consequence of our decision-making process,” says Leandro Saucedo, Global Head of Strategy at Acast, “In the Nordics, decision making is about trying to get consensus. If that’s not possible, you try to get at least a qualified majority. This easily leads to flat hierarchies where every voice counts.”5. Collaborate with trustTrust is probably the essential value for digital vikings and it tracks back to their rural heritage. “This is our Jantelagen, the law of Jante,” proposes Malin Lundell, marketing manager at MAG Interactive, “it’s a term that describes a typically Nordic attitude. There’s a strong emphasis on the importance of growing together. If you want to achieve something great, it doesn’t mean you need to throw under a bus your colleagues to succeed.”6. Infrastructure as nation buildingWhen Norse warriors ransacked the British coast, they didn’t go on a single boat (as they do in Asterix comics.) Instead, they used a proper fleet that was big and strong enough to implement their vision. Digital vikings emphasize the importance of infrastructures.Examples proliferate. In 1995, the Swedish government launched a “Home PC offering.” Anyone who bought a computer with an Internet connection could deduct it from the income tax. A few years later, in 1999, the government issued a statement saying that everybody in the country required the broadband because that was the future.It’s not by chance that Sweden boasts one of the fastest average Internet speed in the world. Also in the case of 3G, the adoption was fast and widespread. This was because the government gave the licenses not to the highest bidders but to the companies that promised the best coverage.7. Vikings are a tight-knit community of innovatorsWhen you know that you have a community of vikings to fall back on, you dare to innovate. Sweden’s social welfare system has supported people in taking risks and make their dreams come true. “Universities and colleges are free,” reminds Björn Fant, co-founder of online store Hemmy.se , “in addition, students can get a low-interest loan from the government to cover their living expenses. Someone says that this is the best venture capital we have.”Johannes Schildt, CEO and co-founder of healthcare startup Kyr, adds: “It’s this dual dependency between state and industry that has laid out the foundation for the tech-oriented entrepreneurship that we see today.”MAG Interactive’s officeDespite all the benefits, digital vikings’ history presents its fair share of failures. “You should always remember that this is the second Swedish tech invasion,” comments Leandro Saucedo, “and the first one didn’t go particularly well. A lot of businesses went belly up. A spectacular example of failure was Boo.com, a kind of Lesara avant la lettre that burnt $ 135 million of VC capital in just six months.”But now digital vikings’ longships have the wind in their sails, right? “Nowadays, we have the opposite problem,” adds Leandro, “we’re already at the third wave of invasion. The ecosystem works like a charm but there’s also a lot of pressure that there wasn’t before. All the companies want to be the next Spotify but often they lack the patience and a long-term vision.”—This article is brought to you by TNW X and Adyen with the collaboration of Strossle.

Cryptocurrencies are here to stay and Wall Street investors are gradually warming up to the idea that there’s huge fortune to be made off cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin is probably the most popular cryptocurrency on the market as the coin has outperformed every other asset class. In the year-to-date, Bitcoin has rewarded investors with 666.2% gains and is up by an incredible 3,000% in the last three years.New opportunities for cryptocurrency investorsMany potential investors missed the opportunity to invest in Bitcoin in its early days; and now, not many people can afford to buy Bitcoin at the current price (at time of writing this post, a little over € 7,900) Other relatively newer cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Litecoin are also moving very fast as the cryptocurrency market continues to expand.Interestingly, potential cryptocurrency investors can still find opportunities to invest in the next Bitcoin by buying into newer cryptocurrencies just fresh from their ICOs. Yet with more than 900 cryptocurrencies available for trading on different exchanges, it might be somewhat hard and overwhelming for an investor to know where to start.This article provides precise and concise information on tools you can use to discover new ICO’s and cryptocurrencies in order to make informed decisions.1.Top ICO ListTop ICO List is your one-stop-shop for discovering potential blockbuster ICOs in the cryptocurrency market. Top ICO offers a list of all ICOs but it goes the extra mile to categorize the ICOs to give you a list of the best upcoming ICO.Top ICO also provides insight on some of the best currently active ICOs and it provides information about past ICOs so that you can have a base for benchmarking the performance of any ICO that interests you. Top ICO list also serves a platform where you can find curated whitepapers and one-pagers of ICOs instead of navigating through multiple web pages to access the whitepapers of different blockchain startups.2. ICO BenchICO Bench is a professional ICO grading website that utilizes crowdsourced ratings from expert crypto traders and crypto experts. These experts evaluate the project and look for many different parameters (such as the team, the hard cap, and the white papers) and grade it accordingly. In addition, an assessment algorithm provides its own rating, based on 20 criteria. An ICO can earn up to 40 points in this assessment. Afterward, this rating is combined with the experts’ ratings to calculate one final score.3. CoinGeckoCoinGecko is still in public beta testing but it has proven to be a priceless tool for cryptocurrency traders and investors that want to be ahead of the market.CoinGecko simply provides a real-time ranking of live cryptocurrencies across multiple exchanges. A single glance at CoinGecko provides insight into the cryptocurrency, price in real time, and the percentage gain/decline in the trading session. CoinGecko also provides information on the market cap of different cryptocurrencies. In addition, CoinGecko gives insight into the development and community activity of the coin to show if developers are still backing the stock and it shows if it has a strong community of users.4.Smith + CrownSmith + Crown is setting up shop to be the Bloomberg/Zacks/Financial Times of cryptocurrenciesSmith + Crown provide access to a suite of “indexed public research which has been tagged and summarized for reference and discovery.” The firm also maintains a repository of a curated and comprehensive list of upcoming and active ICOs. The company provides a simple summary for all of the ICO’s on the list (the name of the project, a short description of its ICO, and the start and end date of its token sale). For some of the listed ICO projects, Smith + Crown also offers more in-depth research (for instance a review of the whitepaper, research into the market, and commentary on the team’s strategy).In addition, Smith + Crown offers insight on the availability of detailed information on the founders of an ICO, the availability of its project code and whether the ICO is open to U.S. investors.5.CryptowatchThe aforementioned tools are mostly designed to help you in your research and due diligence before you buy into any ICO or cryptocurrency.Cryptowatch, however, is designed to help you improve the odds of your trading success after you might have bought any cryptocurrency. Cryptowatch provides a live feed of hundreds of cryptocurrencies across eight different exchanges. Cryptowatch’s live feed also tracks the cryptocurrencies across different currencies so that investors in other parts of the world can know how specific cryptocurrencies stack against their fiat currencies.Now that you have gotten your hands on useful tools that can help you discover new ICOs and cryptocurrencies, you’ll need an exchange that helps you get an edge in the market. EXMO is an excellent cryptocurrency exchange that will launch its own EXMO Coin token crowdsale on April 26, 2018, to power the margin loan service on its platform. Users will be able to trade their crypto assets with a leverage, and international token holders will receive another profitable asset on the cryptocurrency market.",5 easy-to-use tools to discover new ICO’s and cryptocurrencies
9972,3926329,2018-03-02 13:41:17,"TNW SitesThis startup is creating the cultural cryptocurrency for museums and institutionsCultural tourism is a big segment of the wider travel and tourism industry. While large online players like TripAdvisor provide a huge amount of information for travellers about museums, landmarks, and historical sites, there is still a need for innovation in the space.For example, the EU has a working group for digitally capturing, preserving, and exploring cultural heritage through new technologies. Austrian startup Cultural Places believes it has an answer by bringing cultural heritage and blockchain technology together. It wants to reinvent every aspect of the cultural industry, from ticketing to fundraising.At its core, Cultural Places is a social network for artists, curators, and patrons, built by Oroundo, whose founders developed the concept over the last three years, which is creating a cultural ecosystem connecting customers and suppliers.The first version of the app has already been deployed with more than 30 institutions and landmarks including the Stephansdom cathedral in Vienna and the Borobudur Buddhist temple in Indonesia.But now it is moving on to its next phase – the Cultural Coin. The token is the platform’s dedicated cryptocurrency for purchasing tickets to museums and theatres or supporting galleries and exhibitions. Cultural Places will be running an ICO to raise financing for further development and deployment of the platform. Long term, the founders envision Cultural Places as the go-to platform for discovering and booking trips.Streamlining ticketingTraditional ticket booking is dogged by high fees, sometimes up to 30 percent, not to mention the high levels of fraud and ticket touting on the secondary market.On Cultural Places, tickets are handled via smart contracts on Ethereum, which removes the need for intermediaries. Smart contracts also allow for sharing and reselling of tickets to avoid anyone being ripped off. Customers get reasonably priced tickets and artists know that their tickets are being sold to actual fans rather than ticket touts.This has been a massive pain point for ticketing across numerous industries and several startups are trying to solve it with the blockchain but Cultural Places is one of the first to design a blockchain solution specifically for this industry.Social network & crowdfundingCultural Places aims to be all-encompassing. It will be a social network for travellers and culture buffs where users can build connections with others that have similar interests and shop on marketplaces for physical and digital goods.The platform helps institutions to collect and analyse user data to refine and hone the content they share to users. Furthermore, this data will inform more precise advertising compared with other social networks.Cultural institutions, like museums, will be able to build offerings using Cultural Places’ API and receive payments using the Cultural Coin cryptocurrency. Beyond that, the platform allows institutions and bodies to digitally represent and spread awareness around their work.All content in the app is created by the institutions themselves so it’s always up to date and accurate. Museums for example are already able to integrate beacon and NFC technology in their buildings with the app to act as a walking tour guide when you’re actually at the location.Furthermore, the crowdfunding feature will help cultural businesses and artists to raise funds in a transparent way amid an environment where cultural investments are under strain. Much like ticketing, the startup claims that the crowdfunding process will be more transparent for all parties. This may be contributing to the costs of running an exhibition or helping to fund an archaeological dig.Lower costs for the userCultural Places promotes its model of transparency and lower fees compared to incumbents in the marketplace but its chief business model is still revenue from transactions like ticket booking.All purchases made on Cultural Places will incur a six percent fee. Of this, three percent goes to Cultural Places and other three percent is distributed across the community: One percent will be returned to the user in Cultural Coins as a sort of loyalty program. Another one percent of the transaction will be distributed to all Cultural Coin token holders as a reward for being part of the ecosystem. And a final one percent will be distributed to all institutions to encourage further participation.The Cultural CoinThe company is holding an ICO for the Cultural Coin, which is supported by the digital marketing agency Digitalsunray. The Cultural Coin is a utility token that will be operational across the platform, though payments will also be available in fiat.In the sale, 1.5 billion coins will be generated, with 900 million (60 percent) of these coins being made public in the sale, concluding on April 5 with all unsold tokens being destroyed. 150 million coins (10 percent) will go into a stability pool; 30 million (two percent) will be reserved for a bug bounty program; 75 million (five percent) will be distributed among existing Oroundo shareholders; and 345 million (23 percent) will be held for other early stakeholders, team members, and advisors in the project.The sale is taking place in five phases: a pre-ICO and four separate sale phases with the value of the coin going up at each phase. In the pre-ICO, the coins are valued at €0.015 and will then increase to €0.018, €0.021, and €0.024 before finishing at €0.030 on the final phase.Unlike many ICOs, the company has already launched a working product with iOS and Android versions of the app. The funds raised by the ICO will help further development of its blockchain features and growing its partner networks. It is working with startup Flashboys for the blockchain implementations. Flashboys is the creator of Wizzle and will list the Cultural Coin on its exchange. Cultural Places is also working with customer satisfaction rating company RateMyTate.The startup will first integrate the blockchain ticketing system this year with a view to building out the payments and crowdfunding features in 2019.This post is brought to you by The Cointelegraphand shouldn't be considered investment advice by TNW.

When you want to access an assistant, pull Jinni out of your pocket, hold your finger on the appropriate button and off you go. Thanks to the API access for the first two platforms, you only lose out on minor functionalities from ‘official’ devices. I don’t own an iPhone so couldn’t test Siri, but as the platform is far less open, I assume it has fewer options available.As you might imagine with a multi-function device, setting up and using the Jinni is slightly fiddly, but the unit I tested is a prototype, so make some allowances. For all platforms apart from Siri you install a custom app that you use for settings and authenticating with the external platforms. It also displays notifications, but it was unclear to me as to which, as with my Alexa experimentation I received most notifications in the Alexa app anyway. At times it was fiddly to use with network timeouts and unresponsiveness, but it’s hard to tell if this is due to the device, the Bluetooth connection, or the assistant service, so your mileage may vary. When it did work, then as you can see from the video below, the audio is thin and quiet, but loud enough for short interactions.I wonder how long Jinni was in production, as now you can use all these assistants on a smartphone via apps, but minus the convenience of the Jinni’s size. The Jinni also lets you control calls and music, so adds an extra, more discrete control option for your devices. I asked the manufacturer what they considered the unique selling point of the Jinni and they highlighted convenience. Aside from some Android smartphones with Google Assistant, you typically need to pull out a phone and open an application. Ok, not massively inconvenient really, but the small discrete nature of the Jinni means you can hang it around your neck, clipped to clothing or on a car or bike, and access an assistant much quicker. Also, once you press an assistant button, it stays awake for 30 minutes so that you can re-access even quicker. I imagine Jinni as a potentially useful device for those whose clothing rarely has pockets, with Jinni paired to a phone in a bag, it’s a small, convenient and affordable device to use your phone without needing to have it your hands.The price point is much less than some official home assistants, or smartwatches, which offer some crossover functionalities. At worst, treat jinni as an opportunity to test the three major assistants on a semi-independent device and see if you would consider buying a dedicated device.",Take your smart assistant with you with Jinni
9974,3928725,2018-03-01 17:04:47,"Behind an abandoned military facility 40 miles northwest of Oslo, Norway built a surveillance base in close collaboration with the National Security Agency. Its bright, white satellite dishes, some of them 60 feet in diameter, stand out against the backdrop of pine-covered hills and red-roofed buildings that scatter the area.Classified documents describe the facility as “state-of-the-art,” with capabilities “previously not released outside of NSA.” Despite a hefty price tag of more than $33 million paid by Norwegian taxpayers, the Norwegian Intelligence Service has kept the operations at the site beyond public scrutiny.The station, code-named VICTORY GARDEN, was ostensibly built to support Norwegian troops serving overseas and to combat terrorism. But its dragnet has also secretly captured records of phone calls and emails transmitted between law-abiding Norwegians and their friends, families, or colleagues in foreign countries, an investigation by The Intercept and the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, known as NRK, has found.In 2014, the data collection at the base was central to a behind-closed-doors dispute between the Norwegian Intelligence Service and the oversight committee that monitors the conduct of the country’s spy agencies, according to sources with knowledge of the incident. The intelligence service argued that the surveillance was lawful and necessary. But the committee disagreed and claimed that the storing and searching of Norwegians’ communication records was legally dubious. The disagreement remains unresolved; meanwhile, the surveillance appears to have continued unabated.The station in Norway grew in the time period from 2004 to 2016.Images: NRK/Norwegian Mapping AuthorityThe cooperation between the Norwegian Intelligence Service and the NSA began officially in the early 1950s, when Norway and the United States signed an agreement called NORUSA. Due to its geographical proximity to the Soviet Union and its submarine bases on the Kola Peninsula, Norway was uniquely positioned to provide intelligence on Soviet submarines, missile systems, and military activity during the Cold War.The countries have since continued to cooperate closely. In 2001, Norway approached the NSA seeking to buy foreign satellite surveillance technology, known as FORNSAT, according to documents obtained by The Intercept from Edward Snowden. Two years later, the NSA provided the Norwegians with four specialist antennas. Each capability was given code names seemingly inspired by different types of gardens – WINTERGARDEN, FLOWERGARDEN, TOPIARYGARDEN, and so forth – together forming a VICTORYGARDEN.Norwegian intelligence sent employees on multiple trips to receive training and test equipment at the NSA, and a delegation from a now-defunct NSA Yakima facility in Washington state traveled to Norway. Meanwhile, NSA employees based in Oslo took delivery of more than 90 containers crammed with electronic equipment, which were sent by boat and airplane, according to an October 2005 article in SIDtoday, an internal NSA newsletter. Two months later, on December 15, 2005, the Norwegian Intelligence Service’s director, Torgeir Hagen, declared VICTORYGARDEN operational. An NSA article describing the base’s opening ceremony concluded: “We have only begun to see future possibilities to benefit both our nations and the free world.”Erik Reichborn-Kjennerud, a researcher at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs, said that the documents provided a rare insight into how Norway’s relationship with the NSA has evolved. It “seems that Norway is asking for more and more capabilities, including training that enables them to better conduct surveillance,” Reichborn-Kjennerud said. “There’s been very little public debate about this in Norway.”Until recently, the surveillance station located near Oslo was so secret that the oversight committee could not mention it in unclassified annual reports. Cryptic references in Norway’s defense budget pointed to “modernization of the Defense Satellite Earth Station” without linking these to the intelligence service. Local media were told the large dishes were used for communications with NATO partners and Norwegian forces overseas.U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, right, talks as he stands with Norwegian Foreign Minister Ine Marie Eriksen Soreide, left, at the State Department in Washington, Thursday, Jan. 11, 2018.Photo: Susan Walsh/APDuring the country’s parliamentary elections in 2017, then-Minister of Defense Ine Eriksen Søreide visited the facility. “Satellite communication is extremely important,” she told Ringerikes Blad, a local newspaper, “when frigates at sea need to communicate with the command center.” She announced an additional 200 million Norwegian kroner ($25 million) funding to strengthen cyber defense and additional satellite equipment.But there is a lot more to the station than enabling “satellite communication.” The documents provided by Snowden state that VICTORY GARDEN can “see 130 foreign satellites” – indicating that it can tap into communications passing across them, including the contents of international phone calls and emails, as well as various types of metadata. (Metadata reveals information about a communication — such as the sender and recipient of an email and the time and date it was sent — but not the written content of the message.)VICTORY GARDEN’s antennas are aimed at countries from which the Norwegian Intelligence Service collects information in support of Norwegian interests and interventions in countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. But Norway’s spies have also used the base for a more controversial purpose, not previously publicly disclosed: For several years, they have collected metadata about Norwegians’ communications with people located in foreign countries and accessed those records through searchable databases. In 2014, the oversight committee found out about that practice and began raising concerns.“Our most important task is to ensure that the Norwegian Intelligence Service does not monitor Norwegians in Norway. It’s not their job,” said the committee’s chair, Eldbjørg Løwer, in an interview for this story. “We were uncertain whether the way they conducted these operations was sufficiently grounded in the law.”Antennas at the Norwegian Intelligence Service surveillance base in Ringerike, 40 miles northwest of Oslo.Photo: Norwegian Armed ForcesThe intelligence service told the committee that Norwegian citizens’ metadata is used to identify new targets. It denied that it used the intercepted communications for “mapping domestic relations or matters relating to Norwegian persons.” The country’s defense minister, Frank Bakke-Jensen, claimed that the spy agency “does not conduct surveillance against Norwegians in Norway.” He added, however, that “the legislation needs to be updated.”In response to questions for this story, Norwegian spy chief Morten Haga Lunde said that a new law currently in the works will solve the oversight committee’s legal concerns. The VICTORY GARDEN base, he added, served an important purpose and helped save lives in 2013 during a terrorist attack on an Algerian gas facility.It is unclear how many Norwegians’ communications have been swept up by the surveillance to date. A spokesperson for the intelligence service said he could not provide that information.",Norway Used NSA Technology for Potentially Illegal Spying
9975,3928726,2018-02-28 12:50:51,"Young Icelanders spend a large part of their lives in an almost entirely English digital world. Photograph: AlamyUnlike most languages, when Icelandic needs a new word it rarely imports one. Instead, enthusiasts coin a new term rooted in the tongue’s ancient Norse past: a neologism that looks, sounds and behaves like Icelandic.The Icelandic word for computer, for example, is tölva, a marriage of tala, which means number, and völva, prophetess. A web browser is vafri, derived from the verb to wander. Podcast is hlaðvarp, something you “charge” and “throw”.This makes Icelandic quite special, a language whose complex grammar remains much as it was a millennium ago and whose vocabulary is unadulterated, but which is perfectly comfortable coping with concepts as 21st-century as a touchscreen.How Iceland became the bitcoin miners’ paradiseRead moreBut as old, pure and inventive as it may be, as much as it is key to Icelanders’ sense of national and cultural identity, Icelandic is spoken today by barely 340,000 people - and Siri and Alexa are not among them.“It’s called ‘digital minoritisation’,” said Eiríkur Rögnvaldsson, a professor of Icelandic language and linguistics at the University of Iceland. “When a majority language in the real world becomes a minority language in the digital world.”Secondary school teachers already report 15-year-olds holding whole playground conversations in English, and much younger children tell language specialists they “know what the word is” for something they are being shown on the flashcard, but not in Icelandic.Because young Icelanders in particular now spend such a large part of their lives in an almost entirely English digital world, said Eiríkur, they are no longer getting the input they need to build a strong base in the grammar and vocabulary of their native tongue. “We may actually be seeing a generation growing up without a proper mother tongue,” he said.An Icelandic fisherman with his mobile phone. Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesThe language has survived major foreign inputs in the past, under Danish rule for example. The impact of English, however, “is unique in scale of impact, intensity of contact, speed of change”, Eiríkur said. “Smartphones didn’t exist 10 years ago. Today almost everyone is in almost full-time contact with English.”The range and volume of English readily accessible to Icelanders has expanded exponentially, most of it more relevant and more engrossing than ever before, said Iris Edda Nowenstein , a PhD student working with Eiríkur on an exhaustive three-year study of the impact of digital language contact on 5,000 people.“Once, outside school you’d do sport, learn an instrument, read, watch the same TV, play the same computer games,” she said. “Now on phones, tablets, computers, TVs, there are countless games, films, series, videos, songs. You converse with Google Home or Alexa. All in English.”Icelandic’s relatively few speakers are also unusually proficient in English and enthusiastic early adopters of new technology. “The obvious worry is that young people will start to say: ‘Okay, so we can’t use this language abroad. If we’re not using it much in Iceland either, then what’s the point?” Eiríkur asked.In what amounts to a perfect storm for such a small language, it is also under siege in the real world. The wild north Atlantic island welcomed almost two million foreign visitors last year, four times the 2008 figure, and immigrants now make up 10% of the population, a five-fold increase in two decades.Mostly EU workers on short-term contracts in fish-processing or tourism, new residents rarely need to master Icelandic, with its three genders, four cases and six verb forms. In the bars, restaurants and shops of downtown Reykjavík, it can be a struggle for locals to get served in their native language.Online, however, is the biggest concern. Apart from Google – which, mainly because it has an Icelandic engineer, has added Icelandic speech recognition to its Android mobile operating system – the internet giants have no interest in offering Icelandic options for a population the size of Cardiff’s.“For them, it costs the same to digitally support Icelandic as it does to digitally support French,” Eiríkur said. “Apple, Amazon … If they look at their spreadsheets, they’ll never do it. You can’t make a business case.”Where Icelandic versions do exist, said Nowenstein, they are not perfect. “You can switch Facebook to Icelandic, but it’s not good at dealing with cases,” she said. “So people get fed up with seeing their names in the wrong grammatical form, and switch back to English.”Max Naylor, a UK academic also involved in the study, said he had emailed and written to Apple several times but had never received a reply. “We’re not expecting a fully-functioning operating system, but the hope is that they will at least open themselves up to collaboration,” he said.The Icelandic government is setting aside 450m krónur (£3.1m) a year over the next five years for a language technology fund it hopes will produce open-source materials developers could use, but the challenge – from apps and voice-activated fridges to social media and self-driving cars – is immense.Icelandic has survived almost unscathed for well over 1,000 years, and few experts worry it will die in the very near future. “It remains the majority, official language of a nation state, of education and government,” Nowenstein said.“But the concern is that it becomes obsolete in more and more domains, its use restricted, so it’s second best in whole areas of people’s lives. Then you worry about Icelanders understanding much less, for example, of their cultural heritage.”In the meantime, Naylor said, literacy rates among Icelandic children are falling as their vocabulary shrinks. “You could soon have a situation where Icelanders will be native in neither Icelandic or English,” he said. “When identity is so tied up with language … it’s hard to know what that will mean.”This article was amended on 27 February 2018 to reflect the fact that Icelandic people are typically referred to by their first name on second mention.",Icelandic language battles threat of 'digital extinction'
9976,3928731,2018-03-02 09:03:21,"We’ve said for some time that Uber and Lyft are exploiting the fact that their drivers don’t understand their own economics and don’t factor in the wear and tear on their vehicles. One former Uber driver did a back of the envelope work up and argued that you’d make more than minimum wage only if your car was more than six years old. The fact that only 4% of Uber drivers continue for more than a year suggests that working for these ride-sharing companies is an unattractive proposition.A large-scale study confirms these doubts about driver pay, and then some. A team from Stanford, Stephen M. Zoepf, Stella Chen, Paa Adu and Gonzalo Pozo, under the auspices of MIT’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research obtained information from 1100 Uber and Lyft drivers using questionnaires and information about vehicle-specific operating costs, such as insurance, maintenance, repairs, fuel and depreciation.Results show that per hour worked, median profit from driving is $3.37/hour before taxes, and 74% of drivers earn less than the minimum wage in their state. 30% of drivers are actually losing money once vehicle expenses are included. On a per-mile basis, median gross driver revenue is $0.59/mile but vehicle operating expenses reduce real driver profit to a median of $0.29/mile.If you gross up the median hourly profit to gross revenue, using the same ratio for gross revenue versus net profit per mile, median gross revenue is only $6.86 an hour, still below minimum wage. These drivers would be better off doing almost anything else. Consider the safety risks. From Wired:Because the ridesharing industry is so new, and laws regulating it so patchwork, official figures are tough to come by, and the big companies don’t share specifics about incidents their drivers report. Still, online forums for drivers brim with descriptions of attacks on drivers by passengers, both verbal and physical, such as a driver posted a video of being spit on and punched.You might think ridesharing companies would be doing everything they can to ensure driver safety. But it turns out what they can do is limited by the kind of businesses they are. Because drivers operate as independent contractors instead of employees, the companies can’t offer true safety training. Under federal law, training is a signifier that someone is an employee, and both Uber and Lyft have fought bitterly against re-classifying drivers as employees. By the very nature of how on-demand businesses operate today, drivers in many ways have to go it alone…Still, if ridesharing companies don’t make their figures public, federal regulators do. “Taxi drivers are over 20 times more likely to be murdered on the job than other workers,” the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration said in 2010. In a 2014 report, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that of 3,200 3,200 taxi drivers who were hurt or killed on the job, 180 sustained injuries caused by a violent person—about 5.6 percent.As if oh so charitable Uber would actually want to spend money on driver safety training….but you get the point.The CEEPR study also points out that the fact that so many drivers lose money also means governments lose out on tax revenues:For tax purposes the $0.54/mile standard mileage deduction in 2016 means that nearly half of drivers can declare a loss on their taxes. If drivers are fully able to capitalize on these losses for tax purposes, 73.5% of an estimated U.S. market $4.8B in annual ride-hailing driver profit is untaxed.More than 80% of the drivers work less than full time. That means most are doing badly despite presumably focusing on peak hours when they can benefit from surge pricing. It’s hard to see how anyone makes anything approaching a living or even an adequate supplemental income: “On a monthly basis, mean profit is $661/month (median $310).”As Lambert pointed out, this looks an awful lot like Marx’s immiseration of the proletariat. From Das Kapital:Within the capitalist system all methods for raising the social productivity of labour are put into effect at the cost of the individual worker […] All means for the development of production undergo a dialectical inversion so that they become a means of domination and exploitation of the producers; they distort the worker into a fragment of a man, they degrade him to the level of an appendage of a machine, they destroy the actual content of his labour by turning it into a torment, they alienate from him the intellectual potentialities of the labour process […], they transform his life into working-time…But as one colleague pointed out, the people who seem keenest about Uber are the affluenza and high-end professionals who can easily afford to pay more for car service. Her take was that this was another manifestation that they now see it as a matter of right to have a servant class at their beck and call. And not even a well treated servant class.Interesting that when the cab drivers were getting their financial throat cut by these uber drivers, they were fine with the situation. Now that they are becoming the low payed servants, crying is their feature. BooHoo……Cab drivers were ALWAYS getting their throats cut. The medallion owners were making bank. The only good thing to come from Uber/Lyft is the collapse in medallion values. And can we please stop JUST using Uber. It’s Uber and Lyft! Lyft has capitalized on the brand destruction of Uber and my friend who (unfortunately) drives for Lyft says they are just as evil. And I have minor quibble with Yves description that affluent professionals are the most defensive of the Uber/Lyft model. Many low income urban workers are ditching public transit and opting for door-to-door service that is only marginally more expensive. My friend says they are invariably the most difficult low fare passengers who never tip and are being conditioned and VERY dependent on the whole cheap fare industry model. I’m beginning to wonder if autonomous vehicles are really the goal or is ride-sharing targeting municipal budgets for public transit.Marco: Sounds from your description that ride-sharing has replaced jitney cabs in under-served neighborhoods. The poor keeping the poor poor, although it is hard to blame people of limited means. (And I am not.) Most people under the age of, oooohhh, 50, have never even heard of jitney cabs. So Uber and Lyft seem like “disruption,” when as the post points out, they are impoverishment.My buddy drives for Lyft and knows it’s a losing proposition. He got laid off and started driving when his unemployment was running out – he basically does it to get out of the house because fortunately he has a well paid wife. As you mention, the people he typically drives are well paid Amazon or other tech company office employees who are too good to take the bus and wind up with personal door to door service sometimes for less than the bus ticket costs. The only way that is possible is by completely screwing the driver.Prediction: If the neoliberals get their way, driving for Uber and Lyft will replace traditional government unemployment benefits. Get out there and make Travis rich or starve.So much of Uber’s popularity is just trendiness, there are so many who just jump on any new internet or app technology no matter how stupid or pointless because its seen as the new trendy thing. If you ask why not take a cab they look at you like your just some old Luddite who hates technology, there is a huge fear I think of people being behind the curve with tech. A form of old technology user shaming. You see a lot of that with social media as well. Not to mention the mainstream media pretending cabs don’t exist anymore.",MIT Study: Median Uber and Lyft Profits Less Than Half Minimum Wage; 30% of Drivers Lose Money | naked capitalism
9977,3928732,2018-03-01 13:00:00,"Burning Out: What Really Happens Inside a CrematoriumFour decades ago, less than 5 percent of American were cremated when they died. Now that figure stands at nearly half. This is how cremation actually works, and the story of what happens to a culture when its attitude about how to memorialize the dead undergoes a revolution.Rosehill Cemetery in Linden, New Jersey, is awash in small-town trappings: tree-lined roads, rolling lawns, and street signs at every corner. On this Wednesday midsummer morning, the familiar routine of loss plays out across the acres. A yellow taxi waits at the end of a row of graves for someone paying their respects. Men and women clad in church clothes line up their cars along the curb and make their way to a grave site. A backhoe digs out some earth, another spot for another resident.This is the textbook way we treat our dead. Someone passes, they’re buried, a headstone marks their place out among the rows in the borough of the departed. But today I’m bound for a different part of the cemetery, one fewer people see—though that fact is rapidly changing.This place is called the columbarium, and at first, the very existence of this vast chamber full of urns can come as a surprise. In the movie version of life and death, a cremated person’s remains sit up on the shelf at home, or friends scatter their ashes in the wind over a sacred locale. In the real world, many cremated people stay in the cemetery, just like their buried counterparts.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowThere are certain words you’re not supposed to say in a crematorium.Rose-colored carpeting covers the floors here. The whir of a vacuum cleaner punctures the silence. Cubby holes or niches line the walls, and the varying sizes and styles of urns within them marks the passing of the eras. Older urns are ornate; one is topped by an eternal flame, while another is shaped like a Bible. One inscribed “Henrietta Leiber, 1866-1933” is shaped like an acorn. Next to it leans a photo of Henrietta, who’s standing behind a chair in a sleeveless white dress and long pearls, her hair fashioned in a bob like a flapper.More contemporary urns are boxier and cleaner in style. They’re also larger, and not for vanity’s sake. The cremation process recovers a lot more of the human body than it used to. Some families have packed their niche with flowers, family photos, or pictures of Jesus. Others skipped the niche entirely and entombed the cremated remains behind a marble plaque. It is a curious thing, as if the body was broken down into its smallest organic parts, then surrounded with stone to protect them.The doors at the back of the Rose Room.Getty ImagesCaren CheslerWe are seeing a fundamental shift in how we approach death and what comes after. Compared to just a few decades ago, vastly more Americans are foregoing the old-fashioned burial and turning to the alternative of cremation. This is what brought me here to Rosehill, and now my tour with Jim Koslovski, president of the Rosehill and Rosedale Cemetery, is about to go deeper into his world to see how cemeteries are dealing with America’s after-death revolution.As I follow him deeper inside the columbarium, we pass through the Rose Room. Urns here are not hidden in niches behind glass, but instead are on display in the open air. I prefer it this way. The glass cases remind me of the razors at the drug store—the ones you can only access by notifying a salesperson with a key. Deeper still, at the very rear of the room, lies a set of stained glass doors. Koslovski slides them open to reveal a hidden set of spy-movie doors, these made of metal. They are solid for a reason: Behind them lies the crematorium itself.The doors open, and we stroll onto what looks like the floor of a factory, but one dedicated to a certain kind of deconstruction.Socially AcceptableThe Nimtala Burning Ghat (Funeral rites) is the oldest and the most famous cremation ground of Kolkata. It is situated in Central Kolkata.Getty ImagesBack in 1980, less than 5 percent of Americans were cremated when they died. That figure now stands at about 50 percent, according to the National Cremation Association of North America. Changing cultural and religious standards are at play here, for sure. But if you want to see one event that accelerated the change, look no further than the Great Recession.“We saw a big uptick in cremation when there was the economic downturn in 2008, when people were losing their jobs. Cremation is a less expensive alternative,” Koslovski says.“Less expensive alternative” may be putting it lightly. Rosehill charges just $180 to cremate a body, although the urn, flowers, and service are extra. A grave, by contrast, can cost $2,500, plus an additional $1,500 to open the ground with a backhoe.Rosehill, located about a half-hour from Manhattan, now cremates about 25 bodies per day and has been expanding its facility to meet the growing demand. It already had three cremation machines, but bought an additional unit in 2013, another in 2016, and expects to have a sixth up and running by the end of the year.The cremator’s rule of thumb: 100 lbs. of human fat is the equivalent of 17 gallons of keroseneOf course, burning the dead isn’t a new concept—it was around long, long before the recession forced Americans to start pinching their pennies. Cremation began in the Stone Age, and it was common though not universal in Ancient Greece and Rome. In certain religions such as Hinduism and Jainism, cremation was not only permitted, but preferred.The rise of Christianity put the brakes on the practice in the West. As early as 330 A.D., around the time that Emperor Constantine adopted Christianity as the Roman Empire’s official religion, Rome outlawed cremation as a pagan practice. The theological reason for the ban was related to the resurrection—it was good to keep the body whole or in one place. Through the Reformation, the Catholic church frowned on or prohibited cremation, though it was used for punishment and hygiene reasons. Jewish law also banned the practice. By the 5th century, cremation had all but disappeared from Europe.The practice saw a resurgence in Europe in the 1870s, mostly because of public health concerns about curbing the spread of disease. The first modern crematory was built in the U.S. in 1876. A second came eight years later. By 1900, there were 20. The practice got another boost in 1963, when the Catholic Church reversed its opinion on cremation during the Vatican II reforms and said cremation was permitted (though ash scattering was not).Today, there are more than 2,100 crematories around the United States, and the cremation resurgence isn’t just about cost. There are other factors including fewer religious prohibitions on the practice and changing consumer preferences, such as the desire for simpler, less ritualized funerals. Our increasingly mobile way of life plays a part, too, says Robert Biggins of Magoun-Biggins Funeral Home in Rockland, Massachusetts “People aren’t growing up in Mayberry RFD and staying there their whole lives, We’re much more mobile. Generation X and Millennials, they stay in a job on average five to seven years.” Americans don’t want to be sedentary in death, either.Simply put, cremation has become socially acceptable. Acceptance varies by state and ethnicity, according to a report by the National Funeral Directors Association, but in places like California, Oregon, and Southern Florida, 60 to 80 percent of the dead are now cremated, while the number is much lower in the Bible Belt and among certain cultures, including Catholics and African-Americans.And there’s one more force pushing cremation as an alternative: Cemeteries are running out of space, Koslovski says. He estimates Rosehill has only 15 years before it’s out of room. It’s no wonder, then, that a lot of cemeteries have applied to build crematoriums—though there’s often opposition, particularly if they’re in a residential area.“There’s a stigma,” Koslovski says. “There’s still a segment of society that see cremation as gruesome or ghoulish, and they don’t want it in their backyard.”How Cremation WorksRosehill CrematoriumCaren CheslerKoslovski and I pass through the double doors. As we stand on the floor of the crematorium, a bell rings out.“What’s that for?” I ask.“That indicates that there’s a hearse probably backing up to the door,” he says. “So when the guys are in here operating, if they’re doing something and they hear the bell, they know someone is coming.”The bodies arrive in caskets, occasionally made of wood but more commonly cardboard. They remain in these containers during the entire stay. There are health reasons for this, such as protecting the technicians from infectious diseases. There are moral reasons—“the family would want them in something,” Koslovski says. There are logistical reasons, too. “It would be extremely difficult to load a set of human remains without a casket. Just think of a body, and trying to put it into a cremation unit.”The caskets go into the crematorium’s walk-in cooler, which is lined with shelves of them. One casket has a label on it from Delta Airlines that says, “Human Remains,"" and under it, ""Delta Cares."" Bodies typically remain a day or two in the cooler, because most states require a 24-hour waiting period between when someone dies and cremation can occur. When something is so final, you want to take a pause.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowFive large cremation units occupy the floor, each covered in diamond-plated aluminum like you might see on a fire truck or a high-end tool box. It’s called a cremation unit, by the way, not an “oven.” And don’t call the process incineration, even though it is. There are certain words you’re not supposed to say in a crematorium.Ovens in the crematorium of ’Barrack X’ at the site of the former Dachau Nazi concentration camp in Bavaria, Germany.Getty ImagesRichard Blanchard“With ovens, you think of Auschwitz, and that definitely has negative connotations, so people shy away from that nomenclature,” says Brian Gamage, director of marketing at U.S. Cremation Equipment in Altamonte Springs, Florida.When a body is ready to be cremated, it is removed from cold storage and placed on a retractable table that looks like a gurney, then wheeled over to one of the machines. Cremation is the kind of business where an error would be catastrophic, unforgiveable, and so Rosehill actually uses two forms of ID to make sure the family gets back the right remains. A copy of the receipt is attached to the outside of the cremation unit, and a metal ID tag, similar to a dog tag, accompanies the deceased inside the unit.While the door can open about 30 to 35 inches wide, most operators open it only a foot or so, enough to accommodate the width of the body. Any more than that will let out too much heat, exposing the operator and the room to fiery temperatures. The body slides in, pushed with a tool or by hand. There are rollers on the gurney and sometimes on the floor of the cremation unit so the casket can slide with ease.A cremation unit has two chambers: the primary chamber, where the body goes, and the secondary or “after” chamber, where the gases generated are burned off.The primary chamber has brick-lined walls, and a floor and roof made of high heat refractory concrete. A burner descends from the roof and heats the chamber to about 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit, enough to break down a body into gas and bone fragments.The resulting gases and particulates travel into the after-chamber, a 30-foot maze designed to retain the gases for about two seconds. The after-chamber subjects the gases to a temperature of 1,700 degrees F to make sure the particles and odor are negligible before everything goes up the stack and out into the atmosphere. Gamage says you can think of the secondary chamber like the catalytic converter on an old car, which neutralizes the emissions of the exhaust system.“Any solid will turn to gas if heated to the right point. That’s essentially what happens to the body, when the tissue is heated to the point where it’s combustible and turns to gas,” Gamage says. “But just like in any combustion device, whether it’s a car or a backyard grill, when you burn something, there’s going to be emissions generated. The key is to design equipment that consumes most of the emissions so that they fall within the state environmental regulations.”The particulates emitted must be less than 0.1 grains per dry standard cubic foot, according to environmental agencies in most states. Problems arise when gases build up in the secondary chamber and begin to overflow. That can happen if the machine isn’t designed properly or if the operator overloads the primary chamber, which can happen for surprising reasons. For example, putting an obese person in the unit at the wrong time of day.As macabre as it may sound, weight is something crematorium operators must worry about. The machine doesn’t know the difference between a person who weighs 150 pounds and a person who weighs 400. It just does its job. The cremator’s rule of thumb is that 100 pounds of human fat is the equivalent of 17 gallons of kerosene. If you have a body that weighs 400 pounds, at least 200 of it will be fat that will burn rapidly. If you put that person into a very hot machine, as the cremation unit tends to be at the end of the day when it’s been running for hours, the chamber may emit smoke and odor out of the stack.“It’s just too much gas for the machine to handle,” Gamage says. “Most experienced operators will do those larger cases as the first cremation of the day, when the machine is colder.”Screens on the Rosehill units.Caren CheslerInside the Rosehill crematorium, I’m staring at a computer monitor that reduces this ritual into raw data. The body inside is a male, it’s the second case of the day, it’s in a cardboard container weighing 201 to 350 lbs, and it has already been there for an hour and 20 minutes. A diagram on the screen shows the machine’s various chambers. Three little blue flames are illuminated under one of the chambers, indicating that “hearth air” is now being blown in to the chamber to help cool it down. It’s currently between 910 and 1150 degrees inside, but moments earlier, the temperature had been 1600 to 1800 degrees.Altogether, it takes about an hour and a half to cremate a body, though that varies depending on the person’s weight and the type of casket they’re in. The time-consuming nature limits the number of bodies each can cremate. During my visit, all five of Rosehill’s machines were in various states of operation just to keep up with demand. Each needs to get five bodies done in eight hours. Rosehill’s cremation units run six days a week, standing idle only on Sundays.Advertisement - Continue Reading Below“For religious reasons?” I ask Koslovski.“No,” he says. “we just need a day off.”Close To HomeGetty ImagesWhen Lisa Tomasello was growing up in a large Italian Catholic family, the death of a relative was just the beginning of a grueling two or three days. Visitors would sign the guest book in the outer room, and form a line to get to the casket. People would sit in front of the body of the deceased, kneeling and praying and making the sign of the cross, before kissing them on the hand, face or lips. “The closer the relation, the closer to the lips,” she says.The immediate family sat in the front row receiving visitors in front of the dead body. Tearful outbursts and cries in Italian were commonplace. During the breaks in the wake, the family would go out for dinner and laugh and tell stories before returning to the funeral home for several more hours of crying. And all that was all before the funeral, which would start at a funeral home, resume at a church, and culminate at a cemetery before everyone was invited back for lunch.But once the body was buried and the headstone placed, then what? Tomasello, who I knew growing up, says it’s a question that nagged at her after every cycle of mourning. Maybe you visit the deceased a few times during the first few years. Maybe you don’t visit them again until another family member is buried in that plot. “My grandparents’ graves haven’t been visited in 30 years,” she says.When Tomasello grew up and her own parents passed away, she wanted something different. She and her siblings decided to have a small service and to cremate their mother’s body when she died. When her father followed a few years later, they dispensed with the formal service and made a toast to him with a shot of Jack Daniels, then had him cremated and divvied up the ashes.“I have my parents in my bedroom and I am comforted with them there,” she says. “There is no pressure or guilt of having to visit them in a cemetery, and they will stay with me until the end of my time.”“My grandparents’ graves haven’t been visited in 30 years.”Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowIt’s hard to let people go. We want them in an urn, to keep them near, sometimes even anthropomorphizing these objects as a way of bringing our loved ones back to life. The urn doesn’t contain mom’s ashes. The urn is mom.I bought a bench on the boardwalk in my town to memorialize my father. Now that bench is my father. When I watch the sunrise and see the bench’s silhouette, he is watching it with me.What Is Left BehindCaren CheslerThere is no easy way to say it: The physical attributes you picture when you envision a loved one—the eyes, the skin, the hair—disappear during the cremation process. Even after all we’ve been through—our experiences and memories, pain and suffering, tests taken, facts learned—one of the biggest parts of our cremated remains is the coffin. “Cremated remains are typically bone fragments and casket ash,” Koslovski says. “Remember, we’re 75 percent water.”Once the heating is over, cremated remains are put onto what looks like a silver baking tray. A technician runs a magnet over them to remove all of the ferrous materials that did not combust during the cremation process. These often come from a person’s staples, screws, hinges, and prosthetic joints. Someone then has to clean by hand any material the magnet missed—say, the bits of glass left behind because someone wanted their father cremated with a bottle of scotch. Those pieces are buried somewhere on the cemetery grounds.“What is that?” I ask, pointing to one of the silver trays of remains.“I don’t know why. It could be something the person was treated with. It’s hard to say. It could have been cancer.”The crematorium puts the bones and ash that remain into a pulverizer, not unlike a food processor. The remains are then put through a sieve and into a container for the family—but not always. Some Asian cultures want to be able to pick through the unpulverized remains to take bone fragments. A skull or hip bone is prized. They don’t want the bone fragments processed at all.Caren CheslerHindus often want the eldest son to commence the cremation process as a rite of passage, so he’s allowed down on the crematorium floor to turn on the machine. Other families just want to observe the process—about a dozen make that request each week. Rosehill allows them to do so, from an observation deck. To Koslovski, it’s about making sure people understand the process, that they’re not afraid or skeptical of cremation because of misinformation or rumor.“[Some people think] you’re cremating multiple people together. You’re reselling caskets. It can be anything. People watch the news.”I press him on the stories, the urban legends about crematoriums. Is any of it true? Do cremated remains from one person ever wind up getting mixed in with another? He explains that everyone is cremated separately and the units are swept thoroughly after every cremation.However, I remember Barbara Kemmis, the spokesperson for the Cremation Association of North America, telling me that while machines are swept or vacuumed between cremations—and that while operators do their best to remove recoverable remains—it’s possible that minute amounts could get caught in tiny wells and divots in the brick walls or concrete floor of the machinery and inadvertently wind up in another person’s cremated remains. Another part of the process that’s perhaps best not to think about.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowThe Things We Cannot BuryCardboard casketsCaren CheslerCremation, like death, is final. But that doesn’t mean you won’t have second thoughts. Susan Skiles Luke, a marketing consultant in Columbia, Missouri, had her mother cremated and buried in a family plot. Now, she wishes it was her mother’s body and not just the cremated remains that was in the grave.“When I go there, which isn't often, I want to feel like her body is under ground, right alongside my grandparents and beloved great aunt, all dressed up in their Sunday best, not some heavy shoebox of something that looks like cigarette ashes,” she said.When her older brother, with whom she was very close, died tragically of a drug overdose 13 months later, skipping the old-fashioned burial in favor of cremation was a godsend. It allowed her to skip the whole public ordeal of a funeral. ""If you're still pissed—maybe they checked out like my bro did—you don't have to go through the public drama of a casket, dealing with the body, to display it not, discussing the circumstances of his death,” she says. ""[You can] deal with the logistics of 'the body' when you're ready.""That's one of the advantages of cremation: You can address your emotional issues with the dead on your own terms. The disadvantage? Now you’re left with the remains, this tangible object impressed with memories. After Luke’s brother passed away, she picked up his ashes on the way home from work, as if it were just another weekday errand. The funeral home was on the way home, after all. ""I was too stupid to ask someone else to pick (my brother) up, and had never done it before. I wasn't prepared for how personal it would feel,” she said. ""I threw my brother's ashes in the trunk with a thump and cried all the way home.”A few years later, when her stepfather passed, she couldn’t even bring herself to pick up the ashes, even as the funeral home kept calling. “I never spoke to them. I listened to one voicemail, politely reminding me to 'come get your dad,' It was the phrase, coupled with the fact 'my dad' was a bunch of ashes stuffed in a box, that just reminded me of that afternoon I picked up (my brother) Tom,” she said.One day, she returned home to find her dad's ashes sitting on her doorstep.She now has two boxes of their remains in storage somewhere, though she doesn’t know exactly where. She asked her husband to hide them somewhere so she didn’t have to look at them. “Not the healthiest reaction,” she admits.Ellen Herman, who sells digital advertising in Los Angeles, is in a similar situation. About nine years ago, her parents died about a year apart and were cremated. She went to a mausoleum in Florida, where her parents lived before they died, to see if there was a place she could put them in a drawer and honor them with some nice words.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowShe meant to, anyway. She never followed through.Ellen Herman hung onto the remains of her parents. They’re in the bags marked ""Neptune Society.""Ellen Herman""They are in my house. Actually, in my bedroom! In boxes, under a bunch of other shit,” she says. ""I had them in the garage for a little while, but that felt wrong too.""Some of their ashes were scattered in various places, individually and combined, and her dad's brother has a bit of her dad, but the bulk are in the box in her house. ""Neither of my brothers wanted the stuff in their homes, and I didn't feel right scattering all of them,” she says. “I suppose the fact that families don't live as close together as they once did lessens the significance of a burial plot to visit, but I still find the remains sitting in a box in my bedroom less than ideal and respectful.""Sometimes, instead of burying people in the ground, we bury them among our stuff. We lose them among the emotionally charged paraphernalia of our lives. It is just too hard.Back to the EarthWe come from the Earth, we return to the Earth. That may be true, but the way we return to the Earth matters on more than an emotional level. It’s an environmental concern. As cremation continues to replace burial as a go-to way of dealing with the dead, the emissions that come along with this process are becoming a serious worry—so much so that people are starting to consider some wild-sounding alternatives for disposing of human remains.There is now a water-based process called alkaline hydrolysis, which is being marketed as a more environmentally friendly postmortem option because it produces less carbon monoxide and pollution. Alkaline hydrolysis involves placing a body in a chamber that is then filled with water and potassium hydroxide and heated to about 320 degrees F at high pressure. After three hours, the body becomes a green-brown tinted liquid and bones are soft enough to be crushed. The bones can be returned to the family, while the liquid can be sent into the sewer system.If this sounds rather dystopian to you, it’s partly because the process was invented as a way to dispose of animals infected with mad cow disease. When farmers in Europe had to put down herds of cattle infected by mad cow disease, their initial answer was to dig trenches, pour gasoline, and set the animal carcasses on fire. When alkaline hydrolysis was introduced in the 1990s, manufacturers made stainless steel vats about 20 feet across into which the carcasses could be thrown. The pressure of the alkaline hydrolysis process would kill the prion—the protein particles in the animal’s brain that are believed to have caused the disease.Advertisement - Continue Reading Below""People think, wow, you dissolved mom, and you’re putting her in the sewer.""In the years since them, some companies have proposed alkaline hydrolysis as a more environmentally friendly solution for human remains. “They took the technology and tried to apply it to the cremation side,” says Gamage of US Cremation Equipment. “It’s capitalism at its finest.”Perhaps unsurprisingly, this process has taken off as a popular post-mortem solution for people. It’s slower. The technology is more expensive: A stainless steel pressurized unit can cost from $175,000 for a basic unit to $500,000 for a high end unit, while a cremation unit costs about $80,000 to $100,000. There are legal issues, too, because the process is prohibited unless a state passes legislation specifically allowing for it.And then there is the “ick” factor: We’re talking about reducing a human body to a soupy mess that goes into the sewer. That may hold some allure for people put off by the idea of burning a body into nothing but bone and ash, but most people haven’t come around to the way byproducts are disposed after alkaline hydrolysis.Koslovski, ever the pragmatist about dealing with death, sees it another way.“People think, wow, you dissolved mom, and you’re putting her in the sewer. I understand that. But my thought is, with embalming, the fluids from your mother are being put in the sewer system as well. It’s the same thing.”The Missing MarkersMexican musicians play next to a columbarium during the Day of the Dead celebration on November 02, 2014 in Morelia, Mexico.Getty ImagesJan SochorIn the movies, characters are always scattering the ashes of a loved one over the side of a boat or off the top of a mountain. In reality, cremation rarely ends that way. The Cremation Association of North America estimates that 60 to 80 percent of cremated remains go home with people who intend to place them in a cemetery or scatter them at a future date. But while that may be their intent, scattering is not as popular as people think.“Based on recent media coverage of people seeking to recover cremated remains lost in fires, floods and mudslides, I suspect a high percentage of remains are in homes,” Kemmis says.There are actually laws dictating where ashes can be spread. In Massachusetts, for instance, the law says cremated remains may be “scattered with candor.” “What does that mean? It means you can’t just run down Main Street and throw them in the air or sprinkle them in your neighbor’s driveway. But there’s nothing to say you can’t sprinkle them in the golf course where your dad hit golf balls for 40 years,” says Biggins of Magoun-Biggins Funeral Home in Massachusetts.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowWhile scattering ashes seems romantic, there’s something to be said about keeping your loved one in one place, and then marking that place with a name.“We mark the graves of our loved ones with a headstone to memorialize them, so we don’t forget them,” Biggins says. He lost his wife tragically when she was 57, and he visits her grave frequently and finds comfort in just seeing her name. “And when I see how many people remember her, they may leave a pebble or a coin, for me to go there on a weekly basis and see dozens of pebbles and coins, it’s heartwarming to see that people remember her.”The law says cremated remains may be “scattered with candor.”As I leave Rosehill cemetery, I decide to stop by the grave of my friend, David, who grew up in Harlem and was dealt a bad set of cards. His mother was an alcoholic. His father had left. And while he had a mother and grandparents, he still wound up in the child welfare services system. He was sent to a city-funded boarding school outside New York and managed to graduate with a football scholarship to the State University of New York at Cortland, but he lasted just one semester before landing back in Harlem. And like something out of a bad movie, he met a girl, was introduced to crack cocaine, lost his job, wound up with HIV and ultimately developed kidney issues that landed him on dialysis for well over a decade. He was on the kidney donor list and was near the top when he died of heart failure in 2015.I’d gone to his funeral, but hadn’t made it out to the cemetery—the one in which I now found myself. I decided to visit his grave. I followed the directions I was given, to Section 48, Row 24, Grave 83. It was a large cemetery, but when I finally found the section, it was easy to find the grave. I was surprised to see nothing marking the spot where he was buried. It was just a patch of dirt with a number “83” handwritten in concrete. There were big marble headstones on one side of him and on the other side, a pile of plastic flowers, bits of light blue ribbon and raffia, styrofoam crosses that said, “I Love You,” and a deflated white balloon, all contained in a little wire fence, as if there was a party in the neighboring grave site the night before, and David hadn't been invited.Caren CheslerAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowThe lack of fanfare for my friend seemed unfair. He’d been so generous, to me, to his addict girlfriend, to his niece in Florida to whom he would send money despite having so little, himself. Without a headstone, no one would even know he was under there – or for that matter, that he’d been up here.Whether it’s a burial or a cremation, the hard part is letting a loved one just float off into obscurity. We need that physical marker, a headstone, a bench, an urn, to show that the person existed, that they once walked this Earth.I went to my car and found a trophy my son had found in the garbage and thrown on the floor of the back seat. It was a football player. I took a black Sharpie from the glove compartment and wrote on the front of the trophy, “David, April 23, 1954 to April 23, 2015.” I walked over to Grave 83 and placed the trophy at the top of the patch of dirt where a headstone might go. I then left a pebble, as people sometimes do, and walked back to my car.A Part of Hearst Digital Media Popular Mechanics participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites.",Burning Out: What Really Happens Inside a Crematorium

A new flagship comes out and bumps the last big name out of the top spot. We’re still a couple of weeks out from the Samsung Galaxy S9/S9+ release date, but the premium handset just got the DxOMark treatment, and it seems the company’s got another feather to put in its flagship’s cap.The site posted a 99 for the S9+, edging out the Pixel 2’s very good camera by a point — and the iPhone X by two. Sure, that’s not exactly the “camera reinvented” message the company was pushing ahead of last weekend’s big announcement at MWC, but it’s certainly in line with the camera-first approach it was promising handset, besting the Galaxy Note 8’s score by five points (the site rated the S8, but not S8+, mind).The site gives the S9+ its highest photo score for a handset so far. The video score, while note quite tops, is still up there. According to DxOMark, “The S9 Plus comes with a camera that hasn’t got any obvious weaknesses and performs very well across all photo and video test categories.”The biggest addition this time out is a dual-aperture for low light shots, and indeed, the camera performs admirably on those. The S9+ also sports a zoom lens not found on the S9 (along with a few other features justifying the $120 price difference), which significantly reduces artifacts. The phone also gets high marks for its bokeh effect (for Portrait Mode), which was pretty solid to start with on the last note handset.There are a few small knocks, including artifacts in bright lighting situation, but all in all, the handset looks to be a standout.",The Samsung Galaxy S9+ camera bumps the Pixel 2 for DxOMark’s top spot

It’s a fairly common tactic used to force targets offline.A blog post retelling the incident, GitHub said the attackers hijacked something called ‘memcaching’ — a distributed memory system known for high-performance and demand — to massively amplify the traffic volumes they were firing at GitHub. To do that, they initially spoofed GitHub’s IP address and took control of memcached instances that GitHub said are “inadvertently accessible on the public internet.”The result was a huge influx of traffic. Wired reports that, in this instance, the memcached systems used amplified the data volumes by around 50 times.GitHub’s inbound traffic skyrocketed during the attackGitHub called in assistance from Akamai Prolexic, which rerouted traffic to GitHub through its “scrubbing” centers which removed and blocked data deemed to be malicious. Following eight minutes of the assault, the attackers called it off and the DDoS stopped.In total, GitHub was offline for five minutes between 17:21 to 17:26 UTC, with intermittent connectivity between 17:26 to 17:30 UTC.The service has become critical for any company handling code — very many, indeed — so while an outage is never welcomed, the response in this case is impressive and certainly bodes well. GitHub said it continues this attack, and others, to ensure it is suitably defenced.",The world’s largest DDoS attack took GitHub offline for less than tens minutes
9980,3928891,2018-03-02 00:05:52,"Uber co-founder Garrett Camp is creating a new cryptocurrency0Garrett Camp, best known for being a co-founder of Uber and founder of the accelerator/venture fund Expa, is launching his own cryptocurrency.The currency is called Eco, and Camp wants it to be a digital global currency that can be used as a payment tool around the world for daily-use transactions.There will be one trillion tokens issued initially, of which 50% will be given away to the first one billion verified humans that sign up. 20% will go to the universities running trusted nodes, 10% will go to advisors, 10% will go to strategic partners, and 10% will go to a newly formed Eco Foundation which will be responsible for creating and maintaining the network. Camp as well as a small number of partners affiliated with Expa will also donate $10M to seed the foundation with an operating budget.First, it wants to use only verified nodes for network support and transaction confirmations, meaning someone anonymous couldn’t run a node and confirm transactions like they could do on bitcoin’s network. While this essentially removes issues of 51% attacks or other acts of fraud, it also means it won’t be truly decentralized.Second, Eco will have a large token supply (one trillion, at least initially) and simple web and mobile apps. This is likely the project’s attempt to be more user friendly, meaning a smaller dollar to Eco token conversation rate so regular users aren’t scared away by high token prices, which often happens with bitcoin. Similarly, the web and mobile app directive likely means they want to make wallets easily accessible to anyone regardless of technical ability.The last improvement is that Eco wants to be energy efficient when it comes to transaction verification and token generation, meaning there won’t be a network of electricity-intensive miners supporting the network like some other cryptocurrencies have.Eco is an admirable concept, but not a novel one. Since the early days of crypto, groups have been “copy and pasting” Bitcoin to create their own digital blockchains, all with slight differences that they think will change the world.For example, Litecoin and Ethereum both have faster blockchain which have increased transaction times. Both Telegram’s upcoming token and Kik’s Kin token are trying to be mobile-first, daily-use tokens with a high supply and low token price. Ripple already eschews anonymous nodes and instead uses trusted validator nodes run by legitimate groups chosen by them. Ethereum is working on proof of stake to become more energy efficient, and NEO already has a working one in place.You get the point.There is currently no lack of existing cryptocurrencies with these improved features. Instead, we suffer from a lack of a developed ecosystem which is needed develop and support real-life everyday use cases for these blockchains. It’s not hard to launch a new cryptocurrency, but it is hard to onboard the hundreds and thousands of service providers, merchants and financial institutions that are needed to make a cryptocurrency actually useful.Maybe Eco will have better luck with this. And in fact, signing up partners to build an ecosystem is an area where this new cryptocurrency should thrive, considering Garrett Camp’s involvement and high-profile in the tech industry.Eco hopes to have a test net running by the end of the year, but users can sign up now to claim a username and reserve some tokens.",Uber co-founder Garrett Camp is creating a new cryptocurrency
9981,3928969,2018-03-02 15:35:46,"About TNWTNW SitesCoinbase has no immediate plans to add Litecoin Cash (LCC)A couple of weeks back the Litecoin (LTC) blockchain split in two to form the new Litecoin Cash (LCC) hard fork. But despite some requests from users, it appears that leading cryptocurrency exchange desk Coinbase has no immediate plans to add Litecoin Cash trading pairs on its platform – at least not for the time being.“We’re always monitoring potential forks from a security/stability standpoint, core developer roadmaps and customers perspective.” a spokesperson for Coinbase told TNW. “Ultimately, we want to do what’s best for customers while still being secure and practical.”While the company refrained from providing more details on its plans for the forked currency, it did not rule out the possibility it might get listed on the exchange desk, saying that it is actively “tracking” LCC’s progress.To give you some background: Litecoin Cash aims to replace Litecoin’s Scrypt encryption protocol with SHA-256. The tweak will make it possible to leverage old Bitcoin mining hardware to mine LCC, according to the developers behind this undertaking.The Litecoin Cash team has promised to distribute LCC to Litecoin holders in a 10 to one ratio. This means that if you currently have 10 LTC, you are entitled to 100 LCC. Needless to say, users are finding it difficult to decline an opportunity to score some free tokens.As pointed out by Inverse, the only way to claim LCC (assuming you store your LTC on Coinbase) is to move your funds to a private wallet like Litecoin Core or Jaxx. This way you will have access to your private keys – and thus to your LCC freebie.The reason is that Coinbase has a strict policy against sharing private keys with users.“Our hot wallet/cold storage is not setup in a way where we can release private keys,” Coinbase explained to TNW. “This is standard for exchanges.”Indeed, Coinbase has clarified these terms on its support page, saying “it’s not feasible to provide the private keys to individual wallet addresses.” The company further notes that “[t]his not only ensures your security but it also allows us to reduce the cost of sending digital currency to another Coinbase account.”Meanwhile, several less known exchanges have already opted to list LCC trading on their platforms. The list so far includes YoBit, CryptoBridge, SouthXchange, and Trade Satoshi.Despite some interest from the cryptocurrency community, Litecoin creator Charlie Lee has come forward to dismiss the Cash hard fork and its founders a “scam.”Since on the topic of scams, any fork of Litecoin, calling itself Litecoin something or other, is a scam IMO. Litecoin Cash, Litecoin Plus, Litecoin *… all scams trying to confuse users into thinking they are Litecoin.The statement is somewhat ironic, since Litecoin itself forked off from the Bitcoin blockchain. Still, his concerns are not entirely groundless.Lee has rightfully warned that the Litecoin Cash developers completed a pre-mining session ahead of the hard fork, accounting for about one percent – or roughly 5.5 million LCC – from the entire supply. For context, LCC stands at $0.91 at the time of writing, according to Coin Market Cap.Last December, Coinbase announced support for Bitcoin Cash – a popular hard fork of the main Bitcoin blockchain – after the currency surged up to crack the top five biggest cryptocurrencies by market share. However, the company took several months to green light this move.But as Coinbase already made it clear: the decision will ultimately come down to how the larger crypto-community fares in on Litecoin Cash. So if you’re hoping to claim some free LCC, better move your LTC to a private wallet now.",Coinbase has no immediate plans to add Litecoin Cash (LCC)

The weird thing about this success is that Scandinavian people, in fact, hate success – this is called the Jantelaw.The social code that hates successThe Jantelaw was first described in the 1933 novel, A Fugitive Crosses its Tracks, by Danish author Aksel Sandemose. The Jantelaw was described as a sort of Scandinavian social code in ten points, a bit like the ten commandments of the Bible. The points are very similar and they basically all say the same: “Don’t stand out and don’t think you’re any better or different from the rest.”I’m from Scandinavia myself and I’ve always known about the Jantelaw and the fact that it’s something fundamentally negative. But it seems that our weird tendency to drag each other down might actually be one of the reasons the Scandinavian startup ecosystem is flourishing right now. I got in touch with three Scandinavian startups who all have become successful in spite, or because of the Jantelaw.Make sure you have your shit togetherHeikki Väänänen is the CEO and founder of the Finnish company, HappyOrNot. You have probably seen their distinguished smiley-faces at airports, as their product is present at over 200 airports around the world, where they are analyzing customer satisfaction in real-time.Väänänen thinks that the Jantelaw can, in fact, be beneficial for launching a startup. Since the Scandinavian social code stresses that you shouldn’t think you’re better than anybody, it kind of forces you to work harder and prove it wrong. As an entrepreneur, you need to be even more mindful of your product and to make sure that your idea is properly thought through before you execute it. Because if not, the reward is eternal social scorn.After all, it’s easier to ignore people who dislike your success, if you are actually successful. Having tried becoming successful and failed at it might be the hardest blow in a country ruled by the Jantelaw.Egalitarian society – not JantelawSofia Wingren is the CEO of the Swedish teaching and consultancy company, Hyper Island, that focuses on teaching companies how to become digitally fluent. Wingren, unlike Väänänen, is not willing to accredit the Jantelaw to any part of the success her company has achieved. Or any other company for that matter.She, just like me, has never been used to regarding the Jantelaw as any way to achieve success. It’s the people who fight against it that turn out to be successful, Wingren says.In Wingren’s opinion, the media has misunderstood the concept of Jante. The reason for Scandinavian success is not due to Jantelaw, but in the highly developed welfare society that the Scandinavian countries are famous for.“We have an amazing social system backing us up, should something fail or go wrong,” she says, “this makes it less worrisome for people to quit their job to pursue an idea, because they don’t have to put their families’ health or education at stake in order to do so.”Wingren also points out, that the fact that education is free and accessible for everyone it provides society with a much more diverse workforce. And that is also part of the Scandinavian success.One might argue that because the Jantelaw is so much against individual success, that this might be the reason for the Scandinavian societies focusing so much on the community in terms of, for example, healthcare and education.Wingren admits that Scandinavian companies might be different from others because of their flat work hierarchies, but that’s not the result of an arbitrary social rule. “If people think that the Jantelaw has something to do with success, they are mistaken. The Jantelaw justifies jealousy and pettiness, and is not the reason behind our egalitarian society.”De-glorifying the entrepreneurWhile Wingren and Väänänen might be on different standpoints in regard to the beneficial sides of the Jantelaw, Andreas Cleve Lohmann represents a view that’s placed a bit more in the middle.He is the CEO and founder of the Danish company, Corti.AI. Corti uses AI technology for the Danish healthcare sector to understand, analyze, and diagnose acute illnesses in patients, such as cardiac arrest. According to him, the Danish startup culture could use some more of the Jantelaw.“In Denmark, people have started to over-glorify the idea of founding a startup,” Lohmann explains, “it results in many people attempting ideas that are not necessarily very good, and once the going gets tough, most of the people stop, and only a few tough keep on going.”Lohman, just like Wingren, also points to the Scandinavian welfare society. In his opinion, it keeps a lot of people from really investing all their energy in their startup. Because they know that if they fail, there is not so much to lose. In Lohmann’s opinion, the idea of the entrepreneur needs to be de-glorified and instead it needs to be seen as something serious that, if you do it, you do it right, instead of as some side-project.For better or worse, the Jantelaw is ever-presentNone of these three companies agree on how the Jantelaw is affecting business in the Scandinavia. It works in mysterious ways. However, although they all had different standpoints in regard to Jantelaw, they all had this in common: That no matter if they fight against or embrace the Jantelaw, none of them are entirely free of it either. It’s always there.The Jantelaw is a very nuanced concept and cannot be boiled down to have one good or bad effect on startup cultures.The thing that all Scandinavian countries have in common – besides good welfare systems and a seemingly jealous and unsupportive social code – is the fact that they’re small. Sweden, being the biggest of them, only has a population of just below 10 million.So, if you want to start up a company in one of these countries, you know from the very beginning that you have to think beyond your home market – and that you’ll eventually need to ditch the Jantelaw.",Behind every successful Scandinavian startup is a jealous and unsupportive community

9984,3931753,2018-03-02 15:45:38,"MIT study shows how much driving for Uber or Lyft sucks0Ride-hailing giants Uber and Lyft are delivering pitiful levels of take-home pay to the hundreds of thousands of US independent contractors providing their own vehicles and driving skills to deliver the core service, according to an MIT CEEPR study examining the economics of the two app platforms.The report catalyses the debate about conditions for workers on gig economy platforms, and raises serious questions about the wider societal impacts of tax avoiding, VC-funded tech giants.The study, entitled The Economics of Ride-Hailing: Driver Revenue, Expenses and Taxes, and which was carried out by the MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, surveyed more than 1,100 Uber and Lyft ride-hailing drivers combined with detailed vehicle cost information — factoring in costs such as fuel, insurance, maintenance and repairs — to come up with a median profit per hour worked.The upshot? The researchers found profit from ride-hail driving to be “very low”. On an hourly basis, the median profit was $3.37 per hour, with 74% of drivers earning less than the minimum wage in the state where they operate.They also found a median driver generates $0.59 per mile of driving but incurs costs of $0.30 per mile; and almost a third (30 per cent) of drivers were found to incur expenses exceeding their revenue or to be losing money for every mile they drive.The research also looked at how ride-hailing profits are taxed, and suggests that in the US a majority of driver profits are going untaxed owing to how mileage deduction is handled for tax purposes — suggesting Uber and Lyft’s business are denuding the public purse too.From the study:On a monthly basis, mean profit is $661/month (median $310). Drivers are eligible to use a Standard Mileage Deduction for tax purposes ($0.54/mile in 2016) which far exceeds median costs per mile of $0.30/mile. Because of this deduction, most ridehailing drivers are able to declare profits that are substantially lower. Mean drivers who use a Standard Mileage Deduction would declare taxable profit of $175 rather than the $661 earned. These numbers suggest that approximately 74% of driver profit is untaxed.The authors add that if their $661/month mean profit is representative then the US’ Standard Mileage Deduction facilitates “several billion in untaxed income for hundreds of thousands of ride-hailing drivers nationwide”.So what does the study tell us about the ride-hailing business model? “It tells us that it’s a shitty place to work,” says Mark Tluszcz, co-founder and CEO of Mangrove Capital Partners who has described the gig economy model as the modern day sweatshop, and says his VC firm made a conscious decision not to invest in gig economy companies because the model is exploitative.“It tells you that it’s a great place if you’re a company. It’s really a poor place to be an employee or be a worker.”The exploitative asymmetry of ride-hailing platforms comes because workers have a certain amount of fixed costs but the platform intermediary can just hike its commission at will and lower the service cost to the end user whenever it wants to increase competitiveness vs a rival business.“At the end of the day there are a certain amount of fixed costs [for drivers],” says Tluszcz. “You have to buy a car, you have to get insurance, you have to pay for gas… And if you as an intermediary, which those platforms are, are taking an increasing amount of commission — 10%, 15%, now 20 in most of their markets — and then you’re using the price of the trip as a way of beating your competitor… then you as a driver are sitting there with basically all of your fixed costs and your income is going down and frankly the only way to cover your costs is to spend more hours in the car.“Which is frankly what’s clearly illustrated by this study. These people have to spend so much time to cover their costs when you break it down to an hourly revenue, it’s a pitiful amount. And by the way you have no social coverage because you’ve got to take care of that yourself.”At the time of writing neither Uber not Lyft had responded to a request for comment on the MIT study. But an Uber spokesperson told The Guardian the company believes the research methodology and findings are “deeply flawed”, adding: “We’ve reached out to the paper’s authors to share our concerns and suggest ways we might work together to refine their approach.”Tluszcz was quick to dispatch that critique. “MIT is not some second tier organization that did this study,” he points out. “For me that’s a reference moment when MIT says look, there’s an issue here… There’s something wrong in the model and we can tolerate it for a period of time but ultimately we’re creating this lost generation of people.”“These business are built on situations in the market that are not realistic,” he tells TechCrunch. “They took advantage of a hole in legislation… Governments let that happen. And it made all of sudden services cheaper. But people have to eat. People have to live. And ultimately there’s only 100% of a cake.“Cabbies in the UK are not millionaires; they make a decent living. But they make a decent living because there’s a certain price-point to offer the service. And in every industry you have that. There is a certain fair price point to be able to live in that industry… And clearly right now, in the ride-sharing businesses, you don’t have it.”In Europe, where Uber’s business has faced a series of legal challenges, the company has begun offering some subsidized insurance products for platform workers — including one for Uber Eats couriers across Europe and a personal injury and insurance product for drivers in the UK.In January in the UK it also announced a safety cap on the number of consecutive hours drivers on its platform can accept trips, after coming under rising political and legal pressure on safety and working conditions.Last year Uber also lost its first appeal against an employment tribunal that judged a group of Uber drivers to be workers, not self-employed contractors as it had claimed — meaning they are entitled to workers rights such as holiday and sick pay.Uber also had its license to operate in London withdrawn last fall, with the local transport regulator citing concerns about safety and corporate responsibility as key considerations for not renewing the company’s private hire vehicle license.Tluszcz’s view is that such moves prefigure a more major shift incoming in Europe that could cement permanent roadblocks to business models that function via intentional worker exploitation.“The flaw in the [gig economy] model as a worker is so big that it seems to be quite clear that European governments are going to be looking at this and saying this is just not the European ethos. It’s just not,” he argues. “There’s going to be a moment when all these things are clashing. And I think it’s a cultural clash that we have really, between European values of equity and American values of just pure market capitalism.“You can’t expect somebody making $3.37 an hour to take a part of that to contribute to retirement and social coverage. What the hell do you live on?” he adds.“We’re creating the next lost generation of people who simply don’t have enough money to live and those companies are fundamentally enabling it under the premise that they’re offering a cheaper service to consumers… And I just don’t think Europe will put up with this.”Last month the UK government confirmed its intent to act on this area by announcing a package of labor market reforms intended to respond to changes driven by the rise of gig economy platforms. It dubbed the strategy a ‘Good Work Plan’ — billing it as an expansion of workers rights and saying “millions” more workers would get new day-one rights, coupled with a tighter enforcement regime on platforms and companies to ensure they are providing sick and holiday pay rights.“We are proud to have record levels of employment in this country but we must also ensure that workers’ rights are always upheld,” said the UK prime minister, also emphasizing that her goal was to build “an economy that works for everyone”.It’s likely to publish more detail on the employment law reform later this year. But the direction of travel for gig economy platforms in Europe looks clear: Away from being freely able to exploit legal loopholes and towards a much more tightly managed framework of employment and workforce welfare regulations to ensure that underlying support structures (such as the UK’s national minimum wage) aren’t just being circumvented by clever engineering and legal positioning.“This for me is an inherent dilemma one has between capitalism and some level of socialism which we have in Europe,” adds Tluszcz. “This is a clash of two fundamentally different views of the world and ultimately as a company you have to be a company that views your role in society as one of being a contributor — and tech companies can’t hide behind the fact; they must do the same.“And unfortunately all these ride-sharing businesses, and including most of these gig economy companies, are just trying to take advantage of holes and frankly I don’t see them at all looking at their reason to be as at least having a component of ‘I’m good for the society in which I operate’. They don’t. They just simply don’t care.“That’s a dilemma we have as consumers, because on the one hand we like the fact that it’s cheap. But we wish that people could all have a decent living.”Whether US companies will be forced into a less exploitative relationship with their US workers remains to be seen.Tluszcz’s view is that it will need some kind of government intervention for these types of companies to rethink how their models operate and who they are impacting.“Tech companies frankly have an equal amount of responsibility to be great corporate citizens. And right now it feels — particularly because many of these tech companies are born in the US — it almost feels like this Americanism about them says I don’t have to be a good corporate citizen. I’m going to take advantage of the world for me and my shareholders,” he says.“I’m a capitalist but I do think there’s some moral guidance you have to have about the business you’re building. And the US tech companies, around the world — certainly in Europe — are being highly criticized… Where is your moral compass? And unfortunately, today, sitting here, you have to say they lost it.”",MIT study shows how much driving for Uber or Lyft sucks
9985,3931756,2018-03-01 00:00:00,"What does it take to succeed? What are the secrets of the most successful people? Judging by the popularity of magazines such as Success, Forbes, Inc., and Entrepreneur, there is no shortage of interest in these questions. There is a deep underlying assumption, however, that we can learn from them because it's their personal characteristics--such as talent, skill, mental toughness, hard work, tenacity, optimism, growth mindset, and emotional intelligence-- that got them where they are today. This assumption doesn't only underlie success magazines, but also how we distribute resources in society, from work opportunities to fame to government grants to public policy decisions. We tend to give out resources to those who have a past history of success, and tend to ignore those who have been unsuccessful, assuming that the most successful are also the most competent.But is this assumption correct? I have spent my entire career studying the psychological characteristics that predict achievement and creativity. While I have found that a certain number of traits-- including passion, perseverance, imagination, intellectual curiosity, and openness to experience-- do significantly explain differences in success, I am often intrigued by just how much of the variance is often left unexplained.In recent years, a number of studies and books--including those by risk analyst Nassim Taleb, investment strategist Michael Mauboussin, and economist Richard Frank-- have suggested that luck and opportunity may play a far greater role than we ever realized, across a number of fields, including financial trading, business, sports, art, music, literature, and science. Their argument is not that luck is everything; of course talent matters. Instead, the data suggests that we miss out on a really importance piece of the success picture if we only focus on personal characteristics in attempting to understand the determinants of success.The importance of the hidden dimension of luck raises an intriguing question: Are the most successful people mostly just the luckiest people in our society? If this were even a little bit true, then this would have some significant implications for how we distribute limited resources, and for the potential for the rich and successful to actually benefit society (versus benefiting themselves by getting even more rich and successful).The Italian researchers stuck a large number of hypothetical individuals (""agents"") with different degrees of ""talent"" into a square world and let their lives unfold over the course of their entire worklife. They defined talent as whatever set of personal characteristics allow a person to exploit lucky opportunities (I've argued elsewhere that this is a reasonable definition of talent). Talent can include traits such as intelligence, skill, motivation, determination, creative thinking, emotional intelligence, etc. The key is that more talented people are going to be more likely to get the most 'bang for their buck' out of a given opportunity (see here for support of this assumption).All agents began the simulation with the same level of success (10 ""units""). Every 6 months, individuals were exposed to a certain number of lucky events (in green) and a certain amount of unlucky events (in red). Whenever a person encountered an unlucky event, their success was reduced in half, and whenever a person encountered a lucky event, their success doubled proportional to their talent (to reflect the real-world interaction between talent and opportunity).What did they find? Well, first they replicated the well known ""Pareto Principle"", which predicts that a small number of people will end up achieving the success of most of the population (Richard Koch refers to it as the ""80/20 principle""). In the final outcome of the 40-year simulation, while talent was normally distributed, success was not. The 20 most successful individuals held 44% of the total amount of success, while almost half of the population remained under 10 units of success (which was the initial starting condition). This is consistent with real-world data, although there is some suggestion that in the real world, wealth success is even more unevenly distributed, with just eight men owning the same wealth as the poorest half of the world.Although such an unequal distribution may seem unfair, it might be justifiable if it turned out that the most successful people were indeed the most talented/competent. So what did the simulation find? On the one hand, talent wasn't irrelevant to success. In general, those with greater talent had a higher probability of increasing their success by exploiting the possibilities offered by luck. Also, the most successful agents were mostly at least average in talent. So talent mattered.However, talent was definitely not sufficient because the most talented individuals were rarely the most successful. In general, mediocre-but-lucky people were much more successful than more-talented-but-unlucky individuals. The most successful agents tended to be those who were only slightly above average in talent but with a lot of luck in their lives.Consider the evolution of success for the most successful person and the least successful person in one of their simulations:As you can see, the highly successful person in green had a series of very lucky events in their life, whereas the least successful person in red (who was even more talented than the other person) had an unbearable number of unlucky events in their life. As the authors note, ""even a great talent becomes useless against the fury of misfortune.""Talent loss is obviously unfortunate, to both the individual and to society. So what can be done so that those most capable of capitalizing on their opportunities are given the opportunities they most need to thrive? Let's turn to that next.Stimulating SerendipityMany meritocratic strategies used to assign honors, funds, or rewards are often based on the past success of the person. Selecting individuals in this way creates a state of affairs in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer (often referred to as the ""Matthew effect""). But is this the most effective strategy for maximizing potential? Which is a more effective funding strategy for maximizing impact to the world: giving large grants to a few previously successful applicants, or a number of smaller grants to many average-successful people? This is a fundamental question about distribution of resources, which needs to be informed by actual data.Consider a study conducted by Jean-Michel Fortin and David Currie, who looked at whether larger grants lead to larger discoveries. They found a positive, but only very small relationship between funding and impact (as measured by four indices relating to scientific publications). What's more, those who received a second grant were not more productive than those who only received a first grant, and impact was generally a decelerating function of funding.The authors suggest that funding strategies that focus more on targeting diversity than ""excellence"" are likely to be more productive to society. In a more recent study, researchers looked at the funding provided to 12,720 researchers in Quebec over a fifteen year period. They concluded that ""both in terms of the quantity of papers produced and of their scientific impact, the concentration of research funding in the hands of a so-called 'elite' of researchers generally produces diminishing marginal returns.""Taking these sort of findings seriously, the European Research Council recently gave the biochemist Ohid Yaqub 1.7 million dollars to properly determine the extent of serendipity in science. Coming up with a multidimensional definition of serendipity, Yaqub pinned down some of the mechanisms by which serendipity in science happens, including astute observation, ""controlled sloppiness"" (allowing unexpected events to occur while tracking their origins), and the collaborative action of networks of scientists. This is consistent with Dean Simonton's extensive work on the role of serendipity and chance in the evolution of creative and impactful scientific discoveries.Building on this work, the Italian team who simulated the role of luck in success went one step further in their simulation. Playing God (so to speak), they explored the effectiveness of a number of different funding strategies. They applied different strategies every five years during the 40 year worklife of each agent in the simulation. Without any funding at all, we already saw that the most successful agents were very lucky people with about average levels of talent. What happens once they introduced various funding opportunities into the simulation?This table reveals the most efficient funding strategies over the 40 year period in descending order of efficiency (i.e., requiring the least amount of funding for the greatest return on the investment). Starting at the bottom of the list, you can see that the least effective funding strategies are those that give a certain percentage of the funding to only the already most successful individuals. The ""mixed"" strategies that combine giving a certain percentage to the most successful people and equally distributing the rest is a bit more effective, and distributing funds at random is even more efficient. This last finding is intriguing because it is consistent with other research suggesting that in complex social and economic contexts where chance is likely to play a role, strategies that incorporate randomness can perform better than strategies based on the ""naively meritocratic"" approach.With that said, the best funding strategy of them all was one where an equal number of funding was distributed to everyone. Distributing funds at a rate of 1 unit every five months resulted in 60% of the most talented individuals having a greater than average level of success, and distributing funds at a rate of 5 units every six months resulted in 100% of the most talented individuals having an impact! This suggests that if a funding agency or government has more money available to distribute, they'd be wise to use that extra money to distribute money to everyone, rather than to only a select few. As the researchers conclude,""[I]f the goal is to reward the most talented person (thus increasing their final level of success), it is much more convenient to distribute periodically (even small) equal amounts of capital to all individuals rather than to give a greater capital only to a small percentage of them, selected through their level of success - already reached - at the moment of the distribution.""Stimulating the EnvironmentThis incredible Italian team didn't even stop there! Hey, if you're playing God, why not go all the way. :) They also ran simulations in which they varied the environment of the agents. Using this framework, they simulated either a very stimulating environment, rich of opportunities for everyone (like that of rich and industrialized countries such as the U.S.) as well as a much less stimulating environment, with very few opportunities (like that of Third World countries). Here's what they found:Success of the Most Successful Individuals Living in an Environment with Rich Opportunities (top) or an Environment with Poor Opportunities (bottom)Credit: Pluchino, Biondo, & Rapisarda 2018Look at the difference between the outcome distribution of the environment rich in opportunities for everyone (top) from the outcome distribution of the environment poor in opportunities for everyone (bottom). In the universe simulated at the top, a number of medium to highly talented individuals were able to reach very high levels of success, and the average number of medium-highly talented individuals who reached at least above average levels of success was quite high. In contrast, in the universe simulated at the bottom of the figure, the overall level of success of the society was low, with an average of only 18 individuals able to increase their initial level of success.ConclusionThe results of this elucidating simulation, which dovetail with a growing number of studies based on real-world data, strongly suggest that luck and opportunity play an underappreciated role in determining the final level of individual success. As the researchers point out, since rewards and resources are usually given to those who are already highly rewarded, this often causes a lack of opportunities for those who are most talented (i.e., have the greatest potential to actually benefit from the resources), and it doesn't take into account the important role of luck, which can emerge spontaneously throughout the creative process. The researchers argue that the following factors are all important in giving people more chances of success: a stimulating environment rich in opportunities, a good education, intensive training, and an efficient strategy for the distribution of funds and resources. They argue that at the macro-level of analysis, any policy that can influence these factors will result in greater collective progress and innovation for society (not to mention immense self-actualization of any particular individual).Note: One suggestion I made to the Italian team is for their future simulations to take into account the real-world finding that talent develops over time, and is not a fixed quantity of the individual. They graciously said this was a valid point and would definitely take that into consideration in their future work.The views expressed are those of the author(s) and are not necessarily those of Scientific American.ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)Scott Barry KaufmanScott Barry Kaufman is an author, researcher, speaker, and public science communicator who is interested in using psychological science to help all kinds of minds live a creative, fulfilling, and meaningful life.

There is a certain fair price point to be able to live in that industry… And clearly right now, in the ride-sharing businesses, you don’t have it.”In Europe, where Uber’s business has faced a series of legal challenges, the company has begun offering some subsidized insurance products for platform workers — including one for Uber Eats couriers across Europe and a personal injury and insurance product for drivers in the UK.In January in the UK it also announced a safety cap on the number of consecutive hours drivers on its platform can accept trips, after coming under rising political and legal pressure on safety and working conditions.Last year Uber also lost its first appeal against an employment tribunal that judged a group of Uber drivers to be workers, not self-employed contractors as it had claimed — meaning they are entitled to workers rights such as holiday and sick pay.Uber also had its license to operate in London withdrawn last fall, with the local transport regulator citing concerns about safety and corporate responsibility as key considerations for not renewing the company’s private hire vehicle license.Tluszcz’s view is that such moves prefigure a more major shift incoming in Europe that could cement permanent roadblocks to business models that function via intentional worker exploitation.“The flaw in the [gig economy] model as a worker is so big that it seems to be quite clear that European governments are going to be looking at this and saying this is just not the European ethos. It’s just not,” he argues. “There’s going to be a moment when all these things are clashing. And I think it’s a cultural clash that we have really, between European values of equity and American values of just pure market capitalism.“You can’t expect somebody making $3.37 an hour to take a part of that to contribute to retirement and social coverage. What the hell do you live on?” he adds.“We’re creating the next lost generation of people who simply don’t have enough money to live and those companies are fundamentally enabling it under the premise that they’re offering a cheaper service to consumers… And I just don’t think Europe will put up with this.”Last month the UK government confirmed its intent to act on this area by announcing a package of labor market reforms intended to respond to changes driven by the rise of gig economy platforms. It dubbed the strategy a ‘Good Work Plan’ — billing it as an expansion of workers rights and saying “millions” more workers would get new day-one rights, coupled with a tighter enforcement regime on platforms and companies to ensure they are providing sick and holiday pay rights.“We are proud to have record levels of employment in this country but we must also ensure that workers’ rights are always upheld,” said the UK prime minister, also emphasizing that her goal was to build “an economy that works for everyone”.It’s likely to publish more detail on the employment law reform later this year. But the direction of travel for gig economy platforms in Europe looks clear: Away from being freely able to exploit legal loopholes and towards a much more tightly managed framework of employment and workforce welfare regulations to ensure that underlying support structures (such as the UK’s national minimum wage) aren’t just being circumvented by clever engineering and legal positioning.“This for me is an inherent dilemma one has between capitalism and some level of socialism which we have in Europe,” adds Tluszcz. “This is a clash of two fundamentally different views of the world and ultimately as a company you have to be a company that views your role in society as one of being a contributor — and tech companies can’t hide behind the fact; they must do the same.“And unfortunately all these ride-sharing businesses, and including most of these gig economy companies, are just trying to take advantage of holes and frankly I don’t see them at all looking at their reason to be as at least having a component of ‘I’m good for the society in which I operate’. They don’t. They just simply don’t care.“That’s a dilemma we have as consumers, because on the one hand we like the fact that it’s cheap. But we wish that people could all have a decent living.”Whether US companies will be forced into a less exploitative relationship with their US workers remains to be seen.Tluszcz’s view is that it will need some kind of government intervention for these types of companies to rethink how their models operate and who they are impacting.“Tech companies frankly have an equal amount of responsibility to be great corporate citizens. And right now it feels — particularly because many of these tech companies are born in the US — it almost feels like this Americanism about them says I don’t have to be a good corporate citizen. I’m going to take advantage of the world for me and my shareholders,” he says.“I’m a capitalist but I do think there’s some moral guidance you have to have about the business you’re building. And the US tech companies, around the world — certainly in Europe — are being highly criticized… Where is your moral compass? And unfortunately, today, sitting here, you have to say they lost it.”",MIT study shows how much driving for Uber or Lyft sucks

DeepMind, the Google sister-company responsible for the smartest AI on the planet, just taught machines how to figure things out for themselves.Robots aren’t very good at exploring on their own. AI that only exists to parse data, such as neural networks that decide whether something is a hotdog or not, have relatively little to concentrate on compared to the near-infinite number of things a physical robot has to figure out.To solve this problem DeepMind built a new learning paradigm for AI-powered robots called ‘Scheduled Auxiliary Control (SAC-X).’ This new paradigm gives robots a simple goal like ‘clean up this playground’ and rewards it for completion.The auxiliary tasks we define follow a general principle: they encourage the agent to explore its sensor space. For example, activating a touch sensor in its fingers, sensing a force in its wrist, maximising a joint angle in its proprioceptive sensors or forcing a movement of an object in its visual camera sensors.The researchers don’t tell the robot how to complete the task, they simply equip it with sensors (which are initially turned off) and let it fumble around until it gets things right.By exploring its environment and testing the functionality of its sensors, the robot is able to eventually earn its reward: a point. If it fails, it doesn’t get a point.Watching a robot arm fumble around in a box may not seem impressive at first, especially if you’ve seen similar looking robots build furniture. But the amazing part is that this particular machine isn’t following a program or doing something it was designed for. It’s just a robot trying to figure out how to make a human happy.And this work is important: it’ll change the world if DeepMind or another AI company can perfect it. Right now, there isn’t a robot in existence that could walk/roll into a strange house and tidy up. Making a bed, emptying the trash, or putting on a pot of coffee are all extremely complex tasks for AI. There’s a near infinite amount of ways each task could be performed – more if the robot is allowed to use flamethrowers and make insurance claims.At the end of the day, we’re still a long ways away from “Rosie the Robot” from “The Jetsons.” But, if DeepMind has anything to say about it, we’ll get there.

They've always been gorgeous and capable machines, with near bezel-less screens that other computer makers quickly copied. Most importantly, they brought an air of refinement to the Windows laptop market -- something you could previously only find from Apple. Dell's latest XPS 13 continues that tradition of excellence, though there are some changes that might irk longtime fans of the lineup.ConsSummaryDell’s latest XPS 13 doesn’t stray from the line’s high standards. It’s fast, slim and sturdy. Sure, the company didn’t change much, but it didn’t really have to.HardwareAs you'd expect, the XPS 13 still feels like a high-end machine, thanks to its sleek aluminum case and rock-solid build quality. This time around, Dell added a white interior to its rose-gold case to make it more fashionable. It might just be a taste issue, but many Engadget editors found the new styling to be a bit too cheap and garish for the XPS line.The woven-glass-fiber palm rest feels comfortable, at least, and Dell claims it's also stain-resistant. Unfortunately, its kryptonite is sunscreen and mustard, so definitely don't bring it to a beach cookout. But, rest assured, you can still snag the XPS 13 with a silver case and black-carbon-fiber interior if you'd prefer to stick with the traditional style.Devindra Hardawar/AOLThis year's XPS 13 comes in a slimmer and lighter package, weighing in at 2.7 pounds and measuring between 7.8 mm and 11.6 mm thick. In comparison, the previous XPS 13 was a bit heavier if you wanted a touchscreen, at 2.9 pounds. It's light, but because the case looks so thin, it feels denser than you'd expect.To make the newer case work, Dell had to drop USB-A ports and a full-size SD card slot. Instead, you've got three USB-C ports, two of which are compatible with Intel's Thunderbolt 3 standard, as well as a micro-SD card slot. And yes, you can charge from any of the USB-C connections. Gamers will also appreciate the ability to hook up an external GPU to the Thunderbolt ports, something that wasn't possible in previous models.Devindra Hardawar/AOLAnd of course, there's a gorgeous 13.3-inch screen available in 1080p or 4K at the high end. You can choose between standard and touchscreen options, and there's HDR support, finally. That'll let you see video that's both brighter and darker than before. The ""InfinityEdge"" bezels are 23 percent thinner than before, according to Dell, though it's not something I noticed at first. (Probably because they were already pretty slim to begin with.)Another minor change: Dell moved the 720p webcam to the center instead of being off to the side. It's still stuck at the bottom of the screen -- which is a casualty of that InfinityEdge display -- but at least it's easier to align your face properly. There are also four far-field microphones in the XPS 13, which will make it easier for you to shout commands at Cortana, or clearly chat with friends over Skype.There aren't really any surprises with the XPS 13: It's simply a solid and refined ultraportable. It's plenty fast, thanks to Intel's eighth-generation processors. It didn't have any trouble keeping up with my daily workflow, which involves juggling dozens of browser tabs, Slack, Spotify, Evernote and a variety of other apps. Still, I was testing a model with an i7 CPU capable of reaching 4GHz with 8GB of RAM -- the entry-level XPS 13s only have 4GB of memory and slower i5 chips.I didn't have a chance to hook up an external GPU to the XPS 13, but honestly, I never had much of a need to. I've never expected ultraportables like this to be capable gaming rigs. So far, Dell has only included integrated graphics in its 13-inch premium laptops. And while that's gotten more capable over the years, it's still never going to let you play high-end games. The larger XPS 15 offers dedicated graphics, but you'll have to give up a bit of portability if you go that route. Of course, lugging around an external GPU box kinda cuts into the portability of the machine as well. But it still offers you a way to game seriously when you're at home or at a LAN party.Devindra Hardawar/AOLThe 4K screen we tested was also impressive: It was bright, sharp and made everything pop. It even fared well in direct sunlight while I was wearing polarized sunglasses (something competitors like the Surface Laptop have trouble with). HDR is a welcome addition. While it's far more essential in your home theater, it's still to be able to enjoy Netflix to its fullest on the go.Thankfully, Dell didn't change the XPS 13's input options much. The keyboard is still a joy to type on, thanks to its generous 1.3mm travel distance and overall responsiveness. It's one of those keyboards where it feels like words just flow out of my fingers. The Precision touchpad is also as smooth and accurate, as we've come to expect.Dell XPS 13 (2018)9:50Surface Book 2 15-inch20:50Surface Book with Performance Base (2016)16:15Surface Laptop14:49Surface Pro13:40ASUS ROG Zephyrus1:50Surface Book with Performance Base (2016)16:15Apple MacBook Pro 2016 (13-inch, no Touch Bar)11:42Apple MacBook Pro with Retina display (13-inch, 2015)11:23Apple MacBook Pro 2016 (15-inch)11:00HP Spectre x360 15t10:17Apple MacBook Pro 2016 (13-inch, Touch Bar)9:55ASUS ZenBook 39:45Apple MacBook (2016)8:45Samsung Notebook 98:16Alienware 137:32HP Spectre 137:07Razer Blade Stealth (Spring 2016)5:48Razer Blade Stealth (Fall 2016)5:36Dell XPS 15 (2016)5:25 (7:40 with the mobile charger)Alienware 154:31Razer Blade Pro (2016)3:48ASUS ROG Strix GL502VS3:03In our battery test, it lasted 9 hours and 50 minutes, which is better than the XPS 2-in-1 and the Zenbook 3, but less than what we've seen from the Surface Laptop and other premium notebooks. The somewhat average performance can be chalked up to the 4K display, which takes more power to drive. The 1080p versions of the XPS 13 should get a few more hours worth of juice.Pricing and the competitionThe XPS 13 starts at $999 with an 8th gen Core i5 CPU, 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. That's decent, but we'd recommend bumping up to the $1,200 model at least, which has 8GB of RAM and a faster 256GB SSD. It'll perform much better, and last longer without needing an upgrade, as well. Frankly, it's about time PC makers started making 8GB of RAM standard. You might have been able to survive with 4GB a few years ago, but these days, Chrome alone could gobble that up quickly.As for alternatives, Apple's 13-inch MacBook Pro starts at $1,300 with a seventh-gen chip, while the Surface Laptop starts at $800 (albeit with an underpowered processor). Just as we've seen for the past few years, the XPS 13 is a strong competitor both in terms of price and performance with other premium ultraportables.Wrap-upDevindra Hardawar/AOLOverall, the XPS 13 remains one of the best ultrabooks on the market. It's fast, sturdy and sports a gorgeous screen. Dell didn't make any big changes to the design, but then again, it didn't really have to. When you've got something as good as the XPS 13 lineup, it's better to stick with what works.Devindra has been obsessed with technology for as long as he can remember -- starting with the first time he ever glimpsed an NES.

9991,3934306,2018-03-02 16:00:00,"Add a luxury Volvo to your list of monthly subscriptions$600 per month includes nearly everything but gas.When Volvo introduced the smallest member of its SUV line, the XC40, it wasn't the car that got all the attention. It was how the Swedish automaker planned on leasing it. With Care by Volvo, would-be XC40 drivers wouldn't invest $35,200 to own the all-wheel-drive vehicle but rather pay a monthly subscription of $600 that includes insurance, routine maintenance, wear and tear, roadside assistance, and zero money down. So yeah, it's a bit like a lease. But better.Gallery: Volvo XC40 | 27 Photos""Better"" has changed markets. The iPhone was like a Palm Treo or Blackberry smartphone but better. Netflix rented DVDs like Blockbuster but better. Laptops are just better desktop computers. What Volvo is doing is a better lease -- and it has the potential to change how we look at car ownership.Although we're inching closer to a future in which autonomous cars are commonplace, the way we actually own cars hasn't changed much. You either purchase a car or lease it. Care by Volvo adds a third option: a near frictionless subscription that includes pretty much everything but gas. When the $600-per-month payment is pitted against the cost of leasing other cars in the same price range, it actually makes financial sense for some.Plus, it's a flat rate. You pay $600 per month for 24 months for the Momentum version of the XC40 or $700 for the R-Design version with better wheels, stiffer suspension, more color options, active-bending lights and a few other upgrades.As always, though, there are caveats. To qualify for Care by Volvo, you have to fit within certain insurance and credit parameters, as determined by Liberty Mutual. So if you have good credit but you have a few points on your driving record that put you outside what an underwriter finds acceptable, you're out of luck. There's no $650-per-month option for a bit higher insurance or to cover your bad credit. It's all or nothing.If you don't qualify for Care by Volvo, the all-wheel-drive (AWD) car starts at $35,200 and you can purchase it as you normally would.I asked about families and couples and how that affects the insurance and price of the car. A Volvo spokesperson said that if the drivers listed on the policy are all within Liberty Mutual's acceptable range, the monthly cost of the car is the same as for a single driver.If you are accepted, Volvo sweetens its subscription deal with the ability to upgrade (or downgrade) to another Volvo after 12 months. After 24 months with the same car, you can walk away at zero cost as long as you stay under 15,000 miles per year. After that, as with a regular lease, you'll accrue a per-mile surcharge.The XC40 packs many of the features found in the outstanding XC90 and XC60, except it has a more compact design intended for younger drivers (millennials), first-time Volvo buyers and folks who simply realize they don't need all the space a larger SUV has to offer.During a test drive in Austin, Texas, I found the XC40 to be a worthy addition to the XC line. Like the XC60 and XC90, its refined interior is one of the best in its class, with clean lines and controls placed exactly where you'd expect to find them. All told, it's one of the easiest cars to master: You immediately know exactly where everything is.The Sensus Connect infotainment system continues to be a favorite of mine. A 12.3-inch touchscreen is available in both the Momentum and R-Design versions of the vehicle I drove. The vertical layout with additional tabs makes for quick navigation while the plethora of options available at the top level of the three main screens means less time delving into submenus that could distract drivers from, well, driving.Both versions of the XC40 are all-wheel drive and have a T5 turbo-charged four-cylinder engine with 248 horsepower and 258 foot-pounds of torque. A T4 front-wheel-drive version with 187 horsepower and 221 pounds of torque is expected in the United States this summer. (This car will not be available through the Care by Volvo program.) The T5 engine doesn't get the pulse racing, but it does make dashing through the city and around corners at least somewhat entertaining. When the accelerator is floored, though, the engine makes a bit of a racket in the cabin.The upcoming version of the XC40 with a smaller engine with front-wheel drive will be cheaper, starting at $33,200. Without driving it, I feel like saving $2,000 on the purchase price for a less capable vehicle seems like a mistake.On the road, the XC40 suspension glides effortlessly on highway and city streets, showing off its luxury pedigree. Volvo also sent me down some rough back roads during my drive. The car performed admirably, mostly smoothing out ruts and potholes. Cornering is tight for a vehicle of its size with body roll kept to a minimum, making some of the more challenging corners during the drive a bit more spirited than expected.While the XC40 is the smallest SUV in the Volvo lineup, it does offer some intriguing storage solutions. The center console is large enough for a small box of tissues with room to spare for a few phones. But just in front of it, the automaker has put a tiny trash bin with a self-closing lid. You know, for all those tissues. The driver's seat has a pull-out drawer with enough room for a small iPad. Meanwhile, the speakers have been relocated from the doors to open up even more space. The compartment is wide enough for a dictionary. I stuck my laptop in there, and there was enough space such that on sharp turns, it actually moved back and forth.The trunk also gets an upgrade with the floor doubling as a fold-up barrier that keeps packages from sliding around the storage area. It's great for keeping your grocery bags from falling over and spilling their contents everywhere.Combine these storage touches with a beautiful interior, striking design, a power train capable of making the commute at least somewhat exciting and suspension that reminds you that you're riding in a luxury vehicle and it would be a mistake for anyone looking for a high-end compact to dismiss the XC40. All of that also makes it the perfect car for Volvo to introduce its Car by Volvo subscription service.The crossover/SUV category continues to grow, and if you're going to experiment with a new form of car ownership, this is the way to do it. The XC40 is at a price point that makes a subscription service financially viable for not only the automaker's loyal customers but also folks new to the brand and the luxury market in general. Plus, some of these potential customers are used to a subscription model for other kinds of goods and services.Beyond cars, the idea of ownership has changed dramatically over the past few decades. We've gone from owning CDs and MP3s to paying for monthly access to music via Spotify and Apple Music. DVDs and Blu-rays have given way to streaming services. We barely own our phones, with many of us swapping them out as soon as something shinier lands on the market.With the speed of car-tech iteration accelerating almost as fast as our phones', having a five-year-old vehicle will soon seem as ridiculous to some as having a five-year-old smartphone. The introduction of mass-produced, self-driving vehicles will only exacerbate the need for subscription-based vehicles. They'll be too expensive to own outright.Right now Volvo is pushing for a future in which ownership is fluid, and it seems to be resonating with people. According to the automaker, it's already racked 20,000 global pre-sales for the XC40 through Care by Volvo. Ninety-one percent of those buyers are new to the Volvo brand. What's more, the company's upcoming V60 wagon will also be available via Car by Volvo, opening the door to bigger sales numbers.Expect other automakers to keep an eye on Care by Volvo. Cadillac and Porsche already have subscriptions services for their top-of-the-line vehicles, but those start at $1,800 and don't exactly speak to the average car buyer. The smartphone generation wants something without hassle that can be swapped fairly quickly; Care by Volvo offers that.Volvo might not have the same luxury cachet of BMW and Mercedes, but if Care by Volvo takes off, expect that to change as people decide that swapping a car as often as a smartphone sounds like a better idea than the usual lease.",Add a luxury Volvo to your list of monthly subscriptions

This is the first time Ubisoft has brought the open world franchise to America -- specifically, to the wilderness of Montana. But it's more than just another free for all shooter. The game is really a statement on the increasing influence of violent religious extremism in the US, and the need for good people to take a stand against them. While we got a brief glimpse at the game's partner mechanics at E3, we recently a had chance to play it for a few hours, and came away mostly impressed.Gallery: Far Cry 5 screenshots | 5 PhotosIt puts you in the shoes of a rookie cop, who's sent to arrest Joseph Seed, the head of a dangerous cult called The Project at Eden's Gate. They're heavily armed, fanatical about their devotion to their leader, also known as The Father, and are quickly taking over more territory. As you'd expect, your plans to arrest Seed quickly go off the rails. You end up becoming part of a resistance movement, whose goal is to take down the cult by going after Joseph Seed and the rest of his family.""The thing that's truly the genesis for [Far Cry 5] is just this feeling like we're on the edge of something,"" said Dan Hay, creative director for Far Cry 5, in an interview with Engadget. ""There are moments in history where you can kind of look back and say, 'Hey this is the moment where everything is changing.' It feels like three years ago, we were heading into one of those. The game is about that. If you're on the edge of something and it was that one time it was all going to go to shit, would you know it?""Like every Far Cry game, you've got a huge world to explore, and you're free to go about your objectives however you like. This time, though, there's a ""Resistance Meter,"" which tracks your progress throughout the game's several regions. You can build up the influence of the resistance by saving captured citizens, destroying Eden's Gate structures, completing missions and liberating outposts from cultists.UbisoftYou can also team up with allies throughout the game, each of which bring different skills to every fight. There's even a dog named Boomer that can retrieve animals you hunt and attack enemies for you. (And yes, you can pet him on-demand.)As is typical for a Far Cry title, the game looks gorgeous, with vast environments that capture Montana's natural beauty. Thankfully, the developers at Ubisoft also made the gameplay more organic. Instead of climbing towers to find things to do, you actually have to seek out and talk to people. You can read into that what you will. Like the entire game, it seems like a metaphor for something all of America needs to do to move forward as a society.During my playtime with the game, I got to explore the outdoor environment, and take down some stray enemies. With the help of an ally, I also cleared a huge cultist base. Doing so took several tries, but the beauty of Far Cry is that you've got multiple ways to solve every problem. For me, going stealthy with a bow and arrow was best.Ubisoft also worked with Mia Donovan, an expert on cults and fringe groups, who helped add a layer of authenticity to Eden's Gate. The game explores why seemingly normal people would be seduced by dangerous organizations, and at points you'll get a first-hand look at how that process works.""I think games have come to a point now where it's okay to explore certain topics,"" Hay said. ""We also understand that at first blush, people are going to look at the game and say you're making a game about this .... And we say hold on, this [other topic] is what we're actually doing. We take a global perspective about things.""While Far Cry 5 is ultimately just a piece of pop culture entertainment, I'm fascinated by how much Ubisoft Montreal is leaning into such a socially relevant story. Of course, you could just play it like any other game in the series, but it's hard to ignore the subtext. It's a game about the resistance, fighting to save America.Devindra has been obsessed with technology for as long as he can remember -- starting with the first time he ever glimpsed an NES.

9993,3934405,2018-02-28 14:00:35,"Study: When CEOs’ Equity Is About to Vest, They Cut Investment to Boost the Stock PriceExecutive SummaryDoes short-termism exist? And, if it does, what’s the underlying cause? A new study finds that the more equity CEOs have vesting in a given quarter, the more they cut investment. Vesting equity encourages CEOs to take actions with destructive long-term consequences. The research suggests that the horizonof pay is more important than the total value. It affects the CEO’s incentives to invest, with major implications for the company’s long-run success and contribution to society.miragec/Getty ImagesAre today’s businesses plagued by short-termism? The narrative is compelling. Executives cut investment to hit short-term earnings targets and trigger bonus payouts, the argument goes. They are egged on by short-term shareholders, who care only about making a quick buck, rather than growing the company for the long term. Moreover, long-term investments — such as reducing carbon emissions, developing blockbuster drugs, or training workers — benefit more than just shareholders. So, the charge that businesses are deprioritizing them leads to concerns that business no longer serves society.But despite how common the charge of short-termism has become, rigorous evidence of short-termism is surprisingly difficult to find. Eighty percent of CFOs say that they’d cut investment to meet earnings targets — but what they say isn’t necessarily what they do. A recent McKinsey study found that a “long-termism” index (including how much a firm invests) is correlated with future long-term stock returns, suggesting that long-termism pays off. But causality could easily run the other way. When a firm’s long-term outlook is worse, it should invest less. This is taught in any Finance 101 class, and is presumably what McKinsey advises its clients.So does short-termism exist? And if it does, what’s the underlying cause?This is what Vivian Fang, Katharina Lewellen, and I set out to study. We wanted to see whether CEO pay packets encouraged short-termism — whether CEOs cut investment to pump up their company’s short-term stock price and then cash out their shares.But it’s extremely hard to document causation rather than simply correlation. Say we found that a CEO cuts investment and then sells their shares. One interpretation is that they cut investment to cash out. But another is that their firm’s long-term outlook is poor. This causes the CEO (correctly) to cut investment and also (rationally) to sell their shares. So, there’s correlation between investment and sales, but no causation.We studied not how many shares the CEO sells, but how many shares are scheduled to vest. Here’s the idea: CEOs’ shares come with a vesting or lock-up period. Only once this period is over can they sell — and they typically do, to diversify their personal investments. So, when the lock-up expires, the CEO is concerned about the stock price. But a lock-up expiring today is driven by the board’s decision several years ago to grant the shares. It’s unlikely that at the time the board would have known the firm’s present outlook. So the decision to grant shares back then, and thus the fact that shares are vesting today, is unlikely to be driven by factors that also determine investment. By focusing on when shares vest rather than when CEOs sell shares, we’re able to show causation — not just correlation — from CEOs’ personal wealth concerns to cuts in investment.We find that the more equity CEOs have vesting in a given quarter, the more they cut investment. This result holds for five different measures of investment and for both vesting stock and vesting options. In addition, vesting equity is positively correlated with the CEO just barely meeting analyst earnings forecasts — suggesting that it causes the CEO to focus on short-term earnings rather than long-term investment.That result is consistent with short-term behavior, but we considered an alternative interpretation. Could the investment cuts actually be efficient? Perhaps stock price concerns are motivating, because they induce the CEO to make tough decisions, such as cutting wasteful investment. If so, we would expect the CEO to improve efficiency in other ways as well, such as increasing sales growth or cutting other expenses. And we find no evidence of that.Moreover, in a new paper with Vivian and Allen Huang, we aim to more precisely document the long-term consequences of short-term incentives. To do so, we study share buybacks and M&A, since — unlike with investment cuts — we can measure the long-term returns to these actions as they have a clear announcement date. We find that the more vesting equity the CEO has in a given quarter, the higher the likelihood is of both buybacks and M&A. Like investment cuts, buybacks and M&A could be good rather than bad — but we find that vesting equity leads to the bad type. It is associated with higher short-term returns to both decisions, but significantly lower long-term returns. In short, vesting equity encourages CEOs to take actions with destructive long-term consequences.What does this all mean for CEO pay? There is widespread belief that CEO pay needs to be reformed, but proposed reforms typically focus on the level of pay. Our research suggests that the horizon of pay is more important — it affects the CEO’s incentives to invest, with major implications for the company’s long-run success and contribution to society. Cutting pay in half will win more headlines than extending the vesting horizon from, say, three to five years, but the latter is likely to be much more important. Indeed, the UK government’s green paper on corporate governance has proposed this extension, and the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund’s remuneration principles advocates making the CEO a long-term shareholder.Cutting the level of CEO pay aims to redistribute the CEO’s share of the pie to other stakeholders. But since the CEO’s slice is small to begin with — in large U.S. firms, it accounts for just 0.05% of firm value — the result would be negligible. Increasing the horizon of pay will encourage the CEO to invest for the firm’s long-term success, growing the pie to the benefit of both shareholders and society.Alex Edmans is a Professor of Finance at London Business School, where he specializes in corporate finance, behavioral finance, and corporate social responsibility.

Files buried in Instagram and the Instagram Direct standalone app’s Android Application Packages (APKs) are files and icons for “Call” and “Video Call”. APKs often show files for unreleased features that are lying dormant in an app waiting to be surfaced when the company is ready to launch them. So it appears Instagram is preparing to launch audio and video calling within its Direct messaging system.You can see the files in this image shared with TechCrunch by reader Ishan Agarwal:This reinforces our report from January about an image of an a video call button spotted by the WAbetainfo blog. At the time this appeared to be only testing internally and Instagram gave us a “no comment”. Similarly, today when presented with this new evidence, an Instagram spokesperson told me “I’m afraid we can’t comment on this one”.But now that the button icons are in APK, which is publicly available but takes work to decompile and comb through, it’s hard for the company to deny the coming launch. Last month it gave me a no comment when TechCrunch spotted a new Giphy GIF sharing feature…which then launched a week later.The addition of voice and video calling would make Instagram a better chat alternative to Snapchat, which first launched video calling in 2014 and enhanced the feature with easier access plus audio and video notes in 2016. It’s actually surprising Instagram hasn’t launched these features already. Beyond Stories, Instagram has been working hard to leapfrog Snapchat with new features like replay privacy controls that Snapchat lacks.Instagram’s competition has contributed to stagnation in the growth of Snapchat Stories sharing, but messaging remains beloved by Snap’s younger users. While Instagram combined ephemeral and permanent image sharing in Direct in April 2017, and launched the standalone Direct app last year, messaging still feels bolted on to Messenger. It was only added in 2013, three years after Instagram started as just a feed.Instagram Direct combines ephemeral and permanent messagingBut if Instagram can become the best way to communicate visually, no matter the medium, it could steal users from Snapchat and make it’s app more appealing to people around the world. Instagram doesn’t monetize messaging itself, but becoming a stand-in for people’s phones could lead to spillover usage of its feed and Stories that show ads.Instagram is meant to be a window into the lives of your friends. Now you get their weekly highlights in the feed, daily adventures on Stories, monologues on Live, asynchronous memes and messages in Direct.

Much like the cheaper Insta360 One and more expensive GoPro Fusion, Rylo's companion mobile app lets you play editor and director. Users can set specific focal points or objects for the frame to follow within a 360-video after the fact, before sharing their masterpiece to Instagram or Facebook. With two 208-degree lenses, 4K video resolution and auto-stabilization tech, it's a pretty neat little camera. Since launching last fall, though, it's only worked with iPhones and iPads, but today, as promised, Android support has arrived.It's not quite that simple, though. While anyone can download the app, not every Android device is equipped to handle 360-degree video. But fret not, for Rylo has published a list of recommended devices with which the camera is fully compatible -- pretty much just the latest Samsung Galaxys and Google Pixels. Also noted are a few handsets that are supported but can't export 360-degree video, and a number of smartphones that simply don't have the right hardware to play nice with Rylo. The list is relatively short, but you can assume if you have a newish top-tier device running Android 6.0 Marshmallow or later, it's likely to be compatible.Other than a different sync cable to get Rylo talking to your Android phone, you get the same camera and accessories in the box for the same $499 price.

Still, they sold less than expected, with reports claiming the company had hundreds of thousands of unsold pairs and a confirmation that Snap took a $40 million bath after completely mis-estimating demand. Despite a rocky launch, it seems that Snap may not be ready to give up on its hardware ambitions just yet. Cheddar is reporting that Snap is planning two new pairs of Spectacles.The second-generation Spectacles are rumored to be ready this fall, about two years after the original. /Cheddar/ claims that the new glasses will focus more on improved performance, but it sounds like they'll be largely similar to the original. Other changes include new colors and waterproofing, something that could make for some fun videos.But Snap is also reportedly going to release a third version that would include two cameras. Given the popularity and functionality that dual cameras have provided in a growing number of smartphones, it makes sense to see Snap give this a shot in its own camera-focused hardware. Finally, Snap is considering partnerships with companies like Warby Parker to put its technology into their own glasses.These more advanced Spectacles would likely not be available until 2019, though the company apparently wanted to have them ready this year.

American Express.Credit Gabriella Demczuk for The New York TimesBig tech platforms — Amazon, Facebook, Google — control a large and growing share of our commerce and communications, and the scope and degree of their dominance poses real hazards. A bipartisan consensus has formed around this idea. Senator Elizabeth Warren has charged tech giants with using their heft to “snuff out competition,” and even Senator Ted Cruz — usually a foe of government regulation — recently warned of their “unprecedented” size and power. While the potential tools for redressing the harms vary, a growing chorus is calling for the use of antitrust law.But the decision in a case currently before the Supreme Court could block off that path, by effectively shielding big tech platforms from serious antitrust scrutiny. On Monday the Court heard Ohio v. American Express, a case centering on a technical but critical question about how to analyze harmful conduct by firms that serve multiple groups of users. Though the case concerns the credit card industry, it could have sweeping ramifications for the way in which antitrust law gets applied generally, especially with regards to the tech giants.The case was first brought by the Justice Department against American Express, Visa, and Mastercard for imposing anticompetitive restrictions on merchants. The credit card industry is a classic case of oligopoly. Despite involving millions of merchants and hundreds of millions of cardholders, the credit card business is controlled by four firms. Merchants who need payment networks lack any real bargaining power and have been stuck paying high rates to the oligopoly — steeper costs that ultimately get passed on to consumers.PhotoBy imposing conditions on retailers that accept Amex cards, retailers were told they could not ask their own customers to use, other credit cards, over an American Express card.Credit Shaun Egan/The Image Bank, via Getty ImagesAs one might expect, the credit card companies use their power to block competition. American Express did this by imposing conditions on retailers that accept Amex cards. Retailers were told they could not ask their own customers to use, say, a Discover card, over an American Express card, even if Discover would be a cheaper option. Discover could provide a merchant like The Home Depot better terms than American Express — but, because of American Express’s restrictions, The Home Depot had no way of reflecting Discover’s lower rates to cardholders, thereby keeping Discover’s competitive advantage from translating into greater market share. This meant card networks had no reason to compete when serving merchants, keeping prices high.The district court ruled that American Express’s “anti-steering” provisions stifled price competition and violated the antitrust laws (Mastercard and Visa settled with the government before trial). But when American Express appealed, the Second Circuit reversed, relying on a new concept to create a special set of rules. The concept is that players in “two-sided” markets are unique because they serve different sets of customers in distinct but related markets, effectively facilitating transactions. American Express, for example, charges both merchants who accept its cards and consumers who use them. Using this concept, the Second Circuit held that the government would have to show that any price increases for merchants also harmed cardholders, or at least didn’t benefit them. In effect, the court introduced a dramatically new rule, making it much more difficult to win important antitrust cases and to stop anticompetitive behavior.The case is now at the Supreme Court. If affirmed, the Second Circuit decision would create de facto antitrust immunity for the most powerful companies in the economy. Since internet technologies have enabled the growth of platform companies that serve multiple groups of users, firms like Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Uber are set to be prime beneficiaries of the Second Circuit’s warped analysis. Amazon, for example, could claim status as a two-sided platform because it connects buyers and sellers of goods; Google because it facilitates a market between advertisers and search users. (An industry trade group representing the tech platforms filed an amicus brief in support of American Express.) Indeed, the reason that the tech giants are lining up behind the Second Circuit’s approach is that — if ratified — it would make it vastly more difficult to use antitrust laws against them.The fact that the tech platforms could effectively be shielded from antitrust is troubling because, in several respects, these firms enjoy dominant market positions that makes antitrust scrutiny of their conduct especially important. By virtue of providing increasingly critical services, tech giants wield immense leverage over the sellers and buyers that rely on their platforms. This power is ripe for abuse. If the Supreme Court ratifies the Second Circuit’s approach, platforms will be able to engage in anticompetitive activity with one set of users, so long as they can plausibly claim that harmful conduct enabled them to benefit another group. Say, for example, that Uber prohibited its drivers from also serving rivals like Lyft, suppressing driver income. Under the current approach, these exclusive agreements would likely violate antitrust law. But under the Second Circuit’s analysis, the case would go nowhere unless plaintiffs could show that this practice also harmed riders.An error has occurred. Please try again later.You are already subscribed to this email.This danger is compounded by the slipperiness of the concept underlying this analysis: the idea of a “two-sided” market. While reports paid for by the credit card industry introduce “two-sided” markets as a novel concept that requires special analysis, markets serving different groups of users have been around for centuries. They include, for example, grain futures exchanges (connecting farmers and buyers of farm products), banking (linking depositors and borrowers) and newspapers (serving advertisers and readers). For decades, courts have recognized that anticompetitive conduct imposed by a newspaper on readers, for example, is no less illegal if it can be shown to benefit advertisers.Indeed, almost all markets can be understood as having two sides. Firms ranging from airlines to meatpackers could reasonably argue that they meet the definition of “two-sided,” thereby securing less stringent review.Oral argument on Monday gave little new insight into how the vote breakdown might fall. Justice Neil Gorsuch pushed an aggressively pro-monopoly line of questions, while Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan were skeptical of arguments offered by American Express. While Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. spoke little, his views may prove decisive. He has criticized unwieldy antitrust standards in the past — a problem that would get much worse if the court rules for American Express.Unless the Supreme Court rejects the Second Circuit’s approach, it will risk immunizing dominant platforms from effective antitrust review, at the very moment when they most need it.Lina M.

9998,3937043,2018-03-01 15:26:41,"Site Mobile NavigationSpotify Files to Go Public on the New York Stock ExchangeDaniel Ek, the chief executive and a co-founder of Spotify. According to a company filing, Spotify had nearly $5 billion in revenue last year, up 39 percent from the year before.Credit Don Emmert/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesSpotify has already won over the music industry, and listeners worldwide, with an online streaming service that makes millions of songs instantly available. Now, it is ready to test its business model on Wall Street.On Wednesday, the company filed a prospectus to sell shares on the New York Stock Exchange, an indication of the imminent arrival of one of the most anticipated technology stocks in years. It was also a signal of the maturation of the streaming market that has already begun to revive the long-struggling music industry.Instead of a traditional initial public offering, Spotify will, as expected, pursue a direct listing of its shares, an unusual process in which no new stock is issued — and therefore no money is raised. However, existing investors and insiders can trade their shares on the open market.But because Spotify is eschewing Wall Street banks to manage the raising of new capital, the listing could face a rockier reception in the markets. Those banks typically spend weeks assessing investor demand for a company’s shares and try to match the amount that hits the market to ensure the shares are supported.According to the prospectus, investors trading Spotify’s shares in private transactions have valued the company as highly as $23 billion. Spotify’s shares will be traded under the ticker symbol SPOT, but there is no indication of when that will begin.The company, showing no shortage of ambition, said that its mission was “to unlock the potential of human creativity by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art and billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by these creators.”For the music industry, Spotify — and the streaming model it has championed — has been a powerful engine. After more than a decade of decline, the global music market began to turn around in about 2015, just as streaming began to take hold.In the United States, for example, streaming now accounts for about two-thirds of recorded music revenues, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, and streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube and SoundCloud have become the new outlets where stars develop and hits are minted.Even so, many artists remain skeptical of the streaming economy, which heavily rewards mainstream hits but has drawn complaints from other songwriters and musicians, particularly those outside the sphere of pop, who feel they are not being adequately compensated for their work.Spotify’s prospectus is the most detailed disclosure the company has given about its business.According to the filing, Spotify, which began its streaming service in Sweden in 2008 and came to the United States three years later, had nearly $5 billion in revenue in 2017, up 38.6 percent from the year before. In 2016, it had grown by 52 percent.By the end of 2017, Spotify, whose full name is Spotify Technology, had 159 million active users, including 71 million who pay for subscriptions; the rest, using the “freemium” model that has become Spotify’s marketing hallmark, get free access to music but are subjected to advertisements.As quickly as Spotify has grown, though, so have its losses. Last year, it had a net loss of $1.5 billion, up from about $650 million the year before. Its largest expense, by far, is the cost of licenses from record companies and music publishers.An error has occurred. Please try again later.You are already subscribed to this email.The prospectus also highlights Spotify’s successes, and its value to the music industry. Through the end of last year, the company had paid more than $10 billion in music royalties since its inception, and its “churn” — a measure of how many paying users cancel each month — has been steadily declining, to 5.5 percent in 2017 from 7.7 percent in 2015.The largest stakes are owned by its two founders: Daniel Ek, the chief executive and the company’s public face, and Martin Lorentzon, who holds no executive position. In addition to their shares, they also have “beneficiary certificates” granting them extra voting rights. In total, Mr. Ek has 37.3 percent voting power over the company, and Mr. Lorentzon 43.1 percent, according to the prospectus.The major record labels also own minority stakes in the company, as a result of licensing deals struck over the years. Sony has the largest, with 5.7 percent; the others were not disclosed.Spotify’s major competitor is Apple, whose co-founder Steve Jobs had long disdained music subscriptions. Apple finally entered the streaming subscription business in 2015 with Apple Music, and recently said that it had 36 million paying users. But according to a recent report in The Wall Street Journal, Apple Music has been outpacing Spotify in its growth in paid subscribers in the United States.The market for public offerings has been robust so far this year. Through late February, 30 companies listed their shares publicly on markets in the United States, raising $11.4 billion from investors. That was the strongest annual start for the market since 2000, according to data from Thomson Reuters.At least some of the highly valued, privately held technology companies, known as unicorns, could move quickly to capitalize on the opportunity and sell shares publicly.Last week, for instance, the online file storage company Dropbox, valued by the private markets at about $10 billion, filed paperwork to raise up to $500 million in an initial public offering.But to convert that paper wealth into actual cash at top dollar, early-stage investors, company founders and employees with stock options need receptive public markets to buy their shares.If the public investors do not think the companies are worth as much as the small number of deep-pocketed investors who dominate the private markets, it could mean the large amounts of paper wealth could be vaporized once the company’s shares start trading.That’s effectively what happened last year, when some prominent public offerings fizzled once the shares were trading publicly. Shares of Snap, the start-up behind the popular Snapchat app, surged when it went public last March, but it has since had difficulty staying above its offering price of $17 a share. And the meal-delivery start-up Blue Apron, which went public at $10 a share last June, is now trading at less than $3 a share.",Spotify Files to Go Public on the New York Stock Exchange
9999,3938453,2018-03-02 18:31:00,"Testing the Galaxy S9+ on a night out in BarcelonaSamsung's new features seem effective, but fall short of being impressive.The Galaxy S9 and S9+ didn't bring revolutionary changes to the table, but promised a ""reimagined"" camera that's supposed to change the way we use our mobile shooters. Most of the biggest changes Samsung implemented revolve around improving low-light photography, so what better way to make full use of our scenic surroundings here in Barcelona than to take the S9+ out for an evening sightseeing tour? Here's what we learned (other than that the Gothic Quarter is really pretty, and it can get pretty cold in Spain).As you follow along below, check out full-resolution versions of the pictures here.First, a quick overview of the S9+'s new tools. It has a Dual Aperture feature which has the primary camera jump from an aperture of f/2.4 to f/1.5 when it senses that the scene isn't bright enough. The wider opening lets in more light, and is currently the biggest on a smartphone, breaking the record previously held by the LG V30 at f/1.6.Then there's multi-frame noise reduction, which was introduced in the S8 but enhanced in the S9 thanks to dedicated RAM built right into the sensor. This way, the camera can more quickly process the 12 images it uses per shot to reduce noise. Together with the dual pixel sensor that debuted in the S7, this is supposed to make for speedy and clear autofocus, even in challenging conditions.Other features, like the S9+'s dual camera and the new super slow-mo video capture are less specific to low-light photography, but we tested them out in a variety of situations anyway.Overall impressionsBefore we dive into the specific features, it's worth noting that in general, the S9+ takes pretty good photos. Samsung has more or less nailed its smartphone cameras, so this comes as no surprise. Both pictures and video have great colors and clarity, especially in daylight. Scenes that are largely shrouded in darkness appear well-lit, too -- to the point where they look even brighter than in real life, especially when shot in full auto mode.Dual ApertureThe Dual Aperture is largely responsible for the brighter images. Since you only have the option of jumping between f/2.4 or f/1.5 (instead of choosing stops in between), there's no way to finesse your settings to get a more realistic shot, unless you go into Pro mode. That's what I'd recommend, though.One of the downsides of shooting at as wide an aperture as f/1.5 is that dynamic range suffers. Parts of the scene that are bright will be blown out, such as the restaurant in the background of my shot of a fountain. Switching over to Pro mode, I was able to use an aperture of f/1.5, push up my shutter speed and decrease ISO to not only reclaim some of that information, but also get a clearer, less noisy picture overall.Another concern with shooting at f/1.5 is that focus might be softer for subjects that aren't close to the camera. But from our testing so far, the difference in clarity really isn't that noticeable. My shots of a cocktail glass in a dark bar appear almost as crisp in f/1.5 as in f/2.4, although you'll notice a bigger difference if you get super close to the subject. The good news is, if you know what you're doing and want to achieve a very shallow focus effect, you can. If not, you won't notice a significant difference in clarity between the two levels.Noise reductionThe S9 and S9+ use 12 images per shot to smooth out noise, and thanks to the built-in DRAM, are able to do so quickly. While we can't observe this in action, the results are evident. There are fewer color specks in general, compared to photos from an S8, and outlines of objects are crisp, which seems to indicate that the MFNR is working. The Dual Pixel autofocus also appears to be effective -- despite my hands shivering in the cold, there is little motion blur in the wide aperture shots.Upon closer inspection, though, I noticed that edges of buildings appeared muddy in many shots. It looks like Samsung's processing software still introduces artifacts that are noticeable when you zoom in, but for your Instagram and Facebook uploads the photos will be more than adequate.We still haven't pushed the S9+ very hard, or spent all that much time with it, so it's difficult to figure out any major issues and trends so far. What I can tell now is that the Dual Aperture feature really does make a difference. You're getting a whole two stops more to play with. All other things constant, images shot at f/1.5 are noticeably brighter than those at f/2.4.Live Focus, super slow-mo and other featuresThanks to the telephoto and wide-angle lens pair on the S9+, you get features like Live Focus and Dual Capture, which snaps two pictures at once -- one up close and one further out. Live Focus helps you get pictures with a nice blurred background while retaining shallow depth of field, but so far appears to struggle in low light. Super slow-mo, which records video at 960 fps, also requires a fair amount of light to work well.My footage of senior mobile editor Chris Velazco trying (very hard) and failing to catch a moving flower with his mouth in a dim restaurant is barely visible. That's not surprising, though -- at such a high frame rate, most cameras need a ton of light to capture anything decent.Overall, the new low-light features seem effective but the results ultimately aren't extremely impressive. The extra large opening will come in handy especially in really dark scenarios, though, so night owls may reap better photo opps with this phone. Still, we'll be putting the S9s through their paces in a full review soon, so stay tuned to see if we learn anything different.Cherlynn is reviews editor of Engadget.

10001,3938549,2018-03-01 00:00:00,"For a book that is crammed with adulteries, alcoholism, betrayals, broken friendships, deportations, deprivation, drug addiction, executions, humiliation, illicit abortions, imprisonment, murder, Nazi atrocities, starvation, torture chambers (on the avenue Hoche, passers-by could hear the screams coming up from the cellars’ air vents), treason and worse, Agnès Poirier’s Left Bank is a remarkably exhilarating read.Above all, it has a terrific cast, with, as leading players, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Albert Camus and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. The novelist, jazz musician and pataphysician Boris Vian, Samuel Beckett and the resident aliens Picasso and Giacometti also feature, as do brilliant African-American musicians and writers such as Miles Davis, James Baldwin and Richard Wright, the vehemently anti-communist Hungarian writer and wife-beater Arthur Koestler and, among the occupiers, the sinister but fascinating German Ernst Jünger, aesthete, entomologist and polymath.Left Bank is an enchanting account of how these exceptionally talented and original people not merely endured these harsh years but also found pleasure, and even a kind of joy, in creating small pockets of private utopia. During the occupation, a leading German commander, Sonderführer Gerhard Heller, shared in this paradoxical pleasure and many years later recalled, ‘I lived in a kind of blessed island, in the middle of an ocean of mud and blood.’Over the course of a decade, both during the occupation and then in the postwar years of austerity, the boldest and brightest Parisians took every opportunity to seize the day.If strict rationing – 1,300 calories a day, if you were lucky – meant it was hard for these Parisians to make merry with the traditional eating and drinking, there were other sources of cheer: easy-going sex (which also kept you warm in unheated rooms), popular music, dancing, artistic creation and endless intense conversations, fuelled by as many cigarettes as the black market could supply. Richard Wright said that the first time he attended an editorial meeting of Sartre’s journal Les Temps modernes, the cigarette smoke was so thick that initially he could not even make out the figure of Simone de Beauvoir in her trademark turban.As the historian Tony Judt once pointed out, the consequence of this pressure-cooker atmosphere was that Paris became more important to the rest of the world in the late 1940s and early 1950s than it had been at any time since the Battle of Waterloo. The free and freed nations soon became fascinated by everything Parisian, from Sartre’s existentialism to Dior’s New Look, and young people from the United States were among the keenest fans.Often funded by government grants to ex-servicemen, budding North American writers found Paris as irresistible in the years immediately after the Second World War as their forebears had in the 1920s, when the dollar had ridden high against the franc. Norman Mailer, Saul Bellow, Nelson Algren (one of Simone de Beauvoir’s lovers), Irwin Shaw and Art Buchwald all set up in the City of Light, though not all of them liked it. Bellow, who, among other things, claimed that he hated French promiscuity, lapsed into serious depression: ‘Paris is the seat of a highly developed humanity, and one thus witnesses highly developed forms of suffering there. Witnesses and, sometimes, experiences. Sadness is a daily levy that civilization imposes in Paris. Gay Paris? Gay, my foot!’By French standards, these visitors were astonishingly well fed and well dressed; by American standards, the Parisians were skinny, shabby and shockingly impoverished. The visitors could hardly believe that world-famous artists and intellectuals could be so poor that they lived in small rooms in cheap hotels and worked in cafes, not because they were bohemians (though they were) but because cafes were warm.Few Americans could resist the temptation to go native. As de Beauvoir wrote to Algren, ‘Young existentialist boys now grow a beard; American intellectual tourists grow beards too. All these beards are awfully ugly! But the existentialist caves are a wonderful success. It is funny, just two blocks – that is all Saint-German-des-Prés – but within those two blocks you cannot find a place to sit down, neither in the bars, cafes, night-clubs nor even on the pavement. Then all around it is just darkness and death.’Poirier is acute and witty on the love–hate relationship between Paris and America, which is one of the major themes of her book. Although left-wing thinkers of every political hue from red to pink were sceptical about American capitalism (incidentally, the French Communist Party hated Sartre and his crowd, and did its best to crush them), their attitude towards both high and low American culture was usually one of frank hero worship. As de Beauvoir commented, ‘American literature, jazz and films had nurtured our youth.’ When Camus asked Sartre if he would like to go to America on behalf of his journal, Combat, Sartre almost jumped for joy. ‘I never saw him so happy,’ Camus reported. The later pages of the book sing the praises of the Marshall Plan, which Poirier regards, justly, as one of America’s greatest achievements.Another of her themes is the unprecedented significance of women in this milieu. In many works of cultural history, women appear simply as wives and daughters, mistresses and muses. But here are the bookshop owners Sylvia Beach (who had published Ulysses in 1922) and Adrienne Monnier, the actresses Maria Casarès (who played Death in Cocteau’s Orphée), Arletty, star of Les Enfants du paradis, notorious for sleeping with the enemy, Brigitte Bardot and Delphine Seyrig. The singers include Juliette Gréco, for whom both Sartre and Raymond Queneau wrote lyrics, and many writers: the novelist Marguerite Duras, the poet Anne-Marie Cazalis, the Horizon representative Sonia Brownell (soon to marry the dying George Orwell), who had been forced to abort Koestler’s child during the Blitz, the novelist and biographer Edith Thomas, Janet Flanner, who reported on Paris for the New Yorker,andDominique Aury, who wrote Histoire d’O under the pseudonym Pauline Réage.Above all, there is de Beauvoir, who, now that the dust has settled, should be seen as the most permanently influential of all these remarkable women and, come to that, men. The Second Sex, written during this period, has surely touched the lives of countless millions, which can hardly be said of Being and Nothingness. Poirier credits de Beauvoir with, among other accomplishments, being the woman whose writings, example and spirit created the likes of Françoise Sagan and Bardot, who were adolescents on the brink of fame in the summer of 1949.Poirier has an enviably clear prose style, as well as a gift for making her characters vivid and, where appropriate, sympathetic. Sartre, for instance, comes across as a much more appealing character here than in many biographical studies. She has a lynx’s eye for telling details, from the ghastly ersatz coffee that Parisians had to choke down to the brands of amphetamine freely available in pharmacies – Luminax, Leviton, Tranquidex, Psychotron (!), Lidepran and Sartre’s excitant of choice, Orthédrine.And she is very good on the stories behind stories, such as the bafflement with which the publisher Gallimard reacted when, three weeks after its publication, Sartre’s seven-hundred-page Being and Nothingness became a freak bestseller. Explanation? ‘It turned out that since the book weighed exactly one kilogram, people were simply using it as a weight, since the usual copper weights had disappeared to be sold on the black market or melted down to make ammunition.’ Perhaps Poirier’s most remarkable achievement is to make her cast seem so interesting and their concerns so urgent that, despite all the horror and the squalor, this Parisian decade can be regarded as a dawn in which for some it was bliss to be alive, and to be young was even better.",Kevin Jackson - Plenty of Sex & Nowhere to Sit

He uses it to teach computer skills to students at the Betenase M/A Junior High School in Kumasi, Ghana.Frimpong InnocentCould you teach computer class without a computer?For Owura Kwadwo Hottish, 33, an information and communications technology teacher in Ghana, it's his only option. At the middle school where he works, there are no computers. So using colored chalk, he painstakingly draws a version of the computer screen onto the blackboard.In mid-February, he shared a Facebook post showing photos of himself teaching Microsoft Word using this method. His story went viral, making international headlines around the world.People praised his incredible attention to detail. ""How many days did you take to draw that?"" one commenter marveled. Indeed, his drawing of the word processing software included dozens of buttons and features, from the File tab to the horizontal scroll bar.And he was lauded for his commitment to the students. ""God bless you for the effort you are putting into grooming our young people,"" wrote another.For Hottish, who spends about 30 minutes making these drawings before every class, teaching this way is really no big deal. ""Every subject is taught on the blackboard here,"" he says.He has taught computer class for six years and currently works at Betenase M/A Junior High School in Kumasi, a city about 250 miles from Accra, the capital of Ghana. He studied computers at the Kumasi Technical University. He does have a computer at home, ""but the battery is too weak to send it to school,"" he says.Via WhatsApp, we chatted with Hottish about his newfound fame, where he learned how to draw and what he wishes most for his students. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.You've captured the world's attention for using a chalkboard to teach a computer program. What do you make of all the hype?I was really surprised. I wasn't expecting my Facebook post to go that far.Your story has been shared all over the world. Why do you think people are so fascinated by it?It's because of the chalkboard illustration of Microsoft Office. How I detailed it.Why didn't you just teach them on a computer?There is no computer and I had no choice but to draw for them.Where did you learn your drawing skills? You are quite good!I studied art and graphic design in secondary school.What else do you teach besides Microsoft Word?We teach them the basics, like turning on and off the computer, components of the personal computer and creating folders.And you do that all on the chalkboard!Yes.When your students actually see a real computer are they able to take what you've learned from the chalkboard and apply it to real life?Yes, but not with ease. They sometimes fumble behind the real computers. [Teaching with a real computer] would be easier for them.Do your students have computers at home?[We live in] a rural community and the students don't have it at all in their homes.People talk about the ""digital divide,"" which keeps poor people from entering the digital age. Does a chalkboard picture of Microsoft Word help kids get a way in, or is it a cruel reminder that they are lacking in equipment?They are lacking more than just equipment.Did your students laugh at you when you first tried teaching them computers on the chalkboard?No. That's the normal way and they're used to it. They were OK since they don't have an option, not having computers at the school.So you're not the first to teach computers on a blackboard!Yeah, that's normal in the rural community.Does anyone ever erase your drawings?Yes, after the students are done and the lesson is over. To make room for the next class.So you have to draw a new screen every time!Yes.I've read in news reports that you've received an outpouring of help from foreigners who want to donate computers to your school. Is that actually happening?No, they are showing interest but nothing has been brought to the school. We are praying that they are able to organize themselves and present us with computers.Do students ever correct your drawings?No, they only tell me if they can't see some portions very well.Have any of your students graduated and gone on to study or work in computers?I can't tell, because when they graduate they move to urban areas to make a living or continue their education.We're all neighbors on our tiny globe. The poor and the rich and everyone in between. We'll explore the downs and ups of life in this global village.

10003,3938710,2018-03-02 21:00:39,"Blockchain will work in trucking — but only if these three things happen0Jonathan Salama is chief technology officer at Transfix, a digital trucking marketplace based in NYC.Sometimes a buzzword gets so overhyped that it deserves some light-hearted mockery. That seems to be the case with “blockchain.” While it’s true that not every industry can benefit from a distributed-ledger technology, the trucking industry most certainly can. In fact, a new consortium called the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) is working to apply blockchain to solve some of the most intransigent problems in trucking.Trucking is a massive industry that affects virtually every American. Trucks move roughly 70 percent of the nation’s freight by weight, according to the American Trucking Association. The Association also found that in 2015, gross freight revenues from trucking were $726.4 billion, representing 81.5 percent of the nation’s freight bill.Companies hailing from each piece of the trucking supply chain have joined BiTA, including: UPS, Salesforce, McCleod Software, DAT, Don Hummer Trucking and about 1,000 more applicants. [Full disclosure: Our company,Transfix, is also a member.]A private blockchain for truckingBlockchain is a shared, distributed ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible like a truck, or intangible like an insurance requirement. The blockchain that supports cryptocurrencies like bitcoin is a public network open to any investor with millions of users around the world. The blockchain we in the U.S. trucking industry foresee is a private one for shippers, carriers and brokers in the BiTA consortium.As a standards organization, BiTA aims to create a common framework to spur the development of blockchain applications for logistics management, asset tracking, transaction processing and more.Why do we need blockchain? Because trucking is an inefficient industry.Why do we need blockchain? Because trucking is an inefficient industry. Manufacturers have a hard time finding trucks to transport their goods. That’s not because there aren’t enough truckers who want the job. In fact, truckers drive more than 29 billion miles with partial or empty truckloads.According to the American Trucking Association, there are roughly 1.5 million trucking companies employing approximately 3.5 million truck drivers. But 90 percent of these companies have six trucks or fewer. This enormously fragmented industry struggles to match shippers (the demand) with carriers (the supply).Blockchain as the Holy GrailMatching shippers with carriers is just one of the problems blockchain could solve. I know because my co-founder at Transfix, Drew McElroy, is a dyed-in-the-wool trucking devotee. Drew was born into the trucking business. His parents, and later Drew, ran a trucking brokerage company with the express aim of matching shippers with carriers. It was brutally inefficient, taking up to three hours of calling and faxing orders to line up a single delivery.If implemented well, blockchain could be the Holy Grail that makes the entire trucking supply chain more efficient. Imagine a cadre of shippers, carriers and brokers collaborating on a secure, frictionless network.What three things need to happen?In my humble opinion as a technologist, I believe three things must happen to make blockchain viable in trucking.Everyone must trust the blockchain as the single source of truthBlockchain is a digital ledger using blocks (or bundles of transactions) that are linked and secured by cryptography. As a result, data entered into the blockchain cannot be modified or corrupted. What’s more, because the ledger is distributed, there is no single central authority that’s in charge of certifying the information. That’s the beauty of the system.But first, we must trust the data being entered into the blockchain. For example, some manufacturers require their carriers to have $250,000 of cargo insurance before they hand-off their goods to be transported. If a carrier enters “yes, we have the insurance” in the blockchain, their customer must trust that to be true. Similarly, carriers must trust the shippers that hire them through the blockchain to pay them for their services.Because the trucking blockchain will be private, all shippers, carriers and brokers will be vetted, and relationships will likely be built through contracts and agreements. I would also suggest a level of interconnectivity of trustable data sources. For example, to ensure that a carrier has satisfied insurance requirements, the blockchain should connect directly with insurance companies.Small carriers and shippers must participate en masseRemember, 90 percent of all trucking companies in the U.S. have six trucks or fewer. These are small businesses. It’s difficult for any small business, not just those in trucking, to have the means to purchase and learn new technology. In order to participate in the blockchain, both carriers and shippers must have access to the software, hardware and knowledge.This task will prove to be difficult. Just look at the electronic logging device (ELD) rule as a recent effort to get truckers to participate in a shared, technology-driven mission. This was a congressionally mandated rule intended to help create a safer work environment for drivers. The Secretary of Transportation required drivers of commercial motor vehicles involved in interstate commerce to log their miles into a device to make sure they do not drive too many consecutive miles (roughly no more than 11 hours under certain conditions). One month before the December 2017 deadline, only 37 percent of 1,600 fleets were ELD-compliant.Imagine a cadre of shippers, carriers and brokers collaborating on a secure, frictionless network.In addition, the costs required to maintain the trucking blockchain system could be substantial (think of the electricity alone that’s needed to power racks and racks of processors).If a critical mass of small carriers do not participate initially in a trucking blockchain, new carriers must join to replace them. That’s because a lack of supply will drive shipping costs up. Finding more trucking businesses is a tall order because there is already a 48,000 driver shortage.The entire industry must embrace data standardizationAll players in the trucking blockchain must agree on how to characterize their data — e.g. what details must every purchase order or invoice contain. I’m heartened that the BiTA is getting in front of this problem, because they are discussing these standardization questions at the very outset.Data standardization is not easy. For example, electronic data interchange (EDI) is a standard in the logistics industry. EDI has been around for more than 30 years, but there is no one overall EDI standard. Different companies use different versions of EDI, which results in very meticulous and time-consuming integration and development work so that companies can collaborate.Blockchain is still in its infancy and holds great promise. But trucking must overcome three challenges for blockchain to take off. Getting one of the nation’s most fragmented and conventional industries to trust a new online network and embrace data standardization will take a lot of time and iteration. If we collectively chart the future with this budding technology and anticipate unintended consequences, I believe blockchain could be more than a buzzword in trucking.",Blockchain will work in trucking — but only if these three things happen
10004,3938711,2018-03-02 20:03:25,"UiPath raising around $120M at $1B+ valuation for its ‘software robots’ for internal business tasks0The initial hype around bots — applications that run partly or entirely using natural language processing, machine learning, computer vision and other AI tech to help consumers ask and answer questions, buy things and get other stuff done — may have waned a bit, but a startup building the equivalent for the enterprise world, in a fast-growing field called robotic process automation, is seeing its star rise.TechCrunch has learned that UiPath, a startup that builds ‘software robots’ for enterprises to help automate legacy and back-office functions, has raised a Series B round of funding that sources tell us is around $120 million — a round that will catapult it to a valuation of over $1 billion.“Catapult” is the operative word here: the company last raised money in April 2017, a $30 million round that valued UiPath, founded in Bucharest, Romania but now headquartered in New York, at around only $109 million, according to data from PitchBook. In other words, this latest funding increases its valuation nearly tenfold.“I’ve never seen an enterprise company grow this fast,” one source close to the company said to us, when we asked how its valuation jumped so high, so quickly.From what we understand, this latest round — which the company will use to continue investing in its product and growth — will include existing investors along with some high profile new backers. A couple of sources have told us that Kleiner Perkins Caulfield Byers is in this round, along with other “household name” VCs (we are still working on figuring out who these might be). Its previous backers include Accel, Credo Ventures, Earlybird and Seedcamp.The company is announcing the funding as soon as next week. It has declined to talk to us for this article. KPCB has not responded to our request for comment, so the final amount and investor names will likely change.Another clue to the final amount and the fact that an announcement is around the corner: just this morning, UiPath filed documents in Delaware that authorized $100 million+ of a Series B & B-1, where the post-money valuation could be as high as $1.15 billion, according to Lagniappe Labs, the creator of the Prime Unicorn Index.RPA as a market is on something of a growth tear at the moment. Grand View Research forecasts that RPA services will be a $8.75 billion market annually by 2024, while Forrester projects revenues of $2.9 billion by 2021. As of the end of 2017, UiPath’s revenues were on a rate of 500 percent growth annually and from what we understand it’s growing even faster now.UiPath, and other companies working in the area of RPA, are filling a gap in the market for large enterprises: while the general trend for businesses is to upgrade their legacy systems with new technology in the longer term, in the short term, many of them are looking for ways of making their existing systems — and staff — more efficient.UiPath uses AI tools like computer vision, machine learning and natural language processing to automate some of the more mundane tasks around administrative systems and processing “paperwork” such as filling out insurance claims, processing invoices, and most recently, running customer contact center operations.The idea is that using UiPath’s bots creates more time for a company’s human workers to focus on using skills that the AI systems can’t (yet?) handle, for example applying advanced judgement skills to help assess the content of an invoice, or the needs of a customer contacting the business.“In the area of finance, for example, a lot of teams spend time creating reports but don’t require them using as much of their judgment skills, leaving the human employees with little time for the analysing part of their jobs,” Accel partner Luciana Lixandru told us at the time of UiPath’s previous funding round. “A software robot that understands what is happening on the screen using computer vision and performs the task as a human would do it becomes a useful tool.”UiPath has fit neatly so far into the fabric of enterprise IT systems and services.In November last year the company said that it counted over 300 large enterprises as customers — customers we’re written about before include Lufthansa, Generali, Telenor and Dong Energy — and from what we understand that number now is around double that, with customers not just in the financial sector, but also healthcare, telecom, public sector, and more.The startup also partners with the wide array of integrators and software providers that these enterprises are already using to help build and run their IT systems, including the likes of Oracle, Accenture, Capgemini, Symphony Ventures and many others.What’s also worth noting is the pedigree of this company. Although now headquartered in New York, UiPath was founded in Romania — a country well known for engineers but not for hatching many huge tech startups (although that is quickly changing). In the wider conversation we’ve been having about how the tech world is still too weighted in favor of Silicon Valley, it’s nice to see this example of how it’s gradually decentralising, and strong startups founded far from the Bay Area are getting the recognition they deserve.Featured Image: Guido Rosa/Ikon Images/Getty Images0CrunchbaseOverviewUiPath’s innovations track record has made it the leading technology provider for the Robotic Process Automation industry. We believe work should be creative and inspiring. Our mission is to eradicate tedious, repetitive tasks and let software robots do the grunt work.

All of which comes at a cost of $719.99 / £739 / AU$1,199.Samsung Galaxy S9 PlusIt’s like the Samsung Galaxy S9 but with more of almost everything – more screen at 6.2 inches, more cameras as there’s a dual-lens one on the back, more RAM at 6GB, a bigger battery at 3,500mAh and more storage, with 128GB built-in.Everything else is much the same as the regular-sized S9 and that’s no bad thing, as it means you get a crystal-clear 1440 x 2960 Super AMOLED display, a top-end chipset, a clever variable aperture camera, stereo speakers and a sleek and curvy metal and glass design.At $839.99 / £869 / AU$1,349 it’s not cheap, but we might not see many - if any - better phones this year.Sony Xperia XZ2Image 1 of 2Image 2 of 2It’s been a long time coming, but with the Xperia XZ2 Sony has finally redesigned its smartphone range, delivering a handset with a curvier, glass-clad look and a reduction in bezel (though still more than many recent flagships).Aside from the new look, the Sony Xperia XZ2 also has a 5.7-inch 1080 x 2160 display with a trendy 18:9 aspect ratio, a 19MP camera that has the honor of being the first smartphone snapper capable of shooting 4K HDR video, a high-end Snapdragon 845 chipset and a 3,180mAh battery that supports wireless charging.There’s also a new Dynamic Vibration System, which can add vibrations to games, movies and music and is paired with a decent set of stereo speakers.It's going to cost a pretty hefty £699 (around $950 / AU$1350) and in Europe at least you should be able to buy it from early April (the US release date is still to be confirmed).Sony Xperia XZ2 CompactImage 1 of 2Image 2 of 2Phone screens are generally getting bigger, but if you prefer something smaller Sony has you covered there, with the Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact.This phone is a lot like the standard Sony Xperia XZ2, but with a smaller 5.0-inch (though just as high resolution) 1080 x 2160 screen. It also has the same powerful Snapdragon 845 chipset, the same 19MP camera and the same stereo speakers.Really the only differences other than the screen size are the build – with the XZ2 Compact trading glass for plastic on the back, the battery, with the XZ2 Compact sporting a smaller 2,870mAh unit, and the Dynamic Vibration System, which the XZ2 Compact lacks (as well as wireless charging).But in most ways that matter this looks to be a real compact flagship, and it'll cost £549 (around $750 / AU$970).Asus Zenfone 5 (2018) / Asus Zenfone 5ZImage 1 of 2Image 2 of 2The Asus Zenfone 5 (2018) and Zenfone 5Z were among the more surprising phones at MWC 2018, as Asus isn’t typically known for high-end phones; yet these phones combine a great design with strong specs and potentially appealing prices.You can’t escape the fact that the Zenfone 5 looks a lot like an iPhone X, thanks to its bezel-free screen with a notch at the top, but that coupled with a shimmery glass back ensures it’s a good-looking device.Specs include a 6.2-inch Full HD+ display, dual-lens cameras, stereo speakers, a 3,300mAh battery, a mid-range Snapdragon 636 chipset and 4GB of RAM.The Zenfone 5Z meanwhile has the same specs but swaps the chipset for a high-end Snapdragon 845 one and increases the RAM to up to 8GB, as well as packing in more storage, with a maximum of 256GB.Prices for the Zenfone 5 haven’t been confirmed, but the Zenfone 5Z is set to start at £500 (around $700/AU$885), which is a low price for a flagship and the standard Zenfone 5 will presumably cost less.Nokia 8 SiroccoImage 1 of 2Image 2 of 2Nokia’s new flagship isn’t the Nokia 9 - instead we got the Nokia 8 Sirocco - but despite having the same number in its name as the Nokia 8 it looks to be a significant upgrade.It has an almost all-glass body with dust and water resistance, and a 5.5-inch 1440 x 2560 curved OLED screen.There’s also a pair of Zeiss-tuned cameras on the back – a 12MP wide-angle lens and a 13MP telephoto one.Other specs include a 3,260mAh battery and 6GB of RAM, with the only slight disappointments being 2017’s Snapdragon 835 chipset (rather than the new 845) and the lack of a headphone jack.If those aren’t deal-breakers for you the Nokia 8 Sirocco will set you back AU$1,199 (around £660, $900) when it launches in April.Vivo Apex ConceptImage 1 of 2Image 2 of 2The one phone on this list you won’t be able to buy is the Apex Concept, because, as the name suggests, this is just a concept handset for now – though one that we were able to try out for real at MWC.The highlight of the phone is its fingerprint scanner, which is built into the screen, and not just a small section of the screen. Rather, it takes up a large portion of the bottom section, so you can hit it with ease.The scanner also lets you secure the phone – or elements of it – with two fingerprints instead of one, and the screen is almost completely bezel-free, with Vivo opting for a pop-up front-facing camera, rather than a notch, and embedding the earpiece and proximity sensor under the display.LG V30S ThinQImage 1 of 2Image 2 of 2Being so similar to the standard LG V30, the LG V30S ThinQ perhaps isn’t one of the most exciting announcements of MWC 2018, but it certainly looks like a great phone, building as it does on its 4.5-star predecessor.Just like the original V30 it has a 6.0-inch 1440 x 2880 OLED screen, a Snapdragon 835 chipset, a 3,300mAh battery and a dual-lens camera, pairing a 16MP lens with a 13MP one.What’s changed is that the V30S ThinQ has more RAM at 6GB, more storage at up to 256GB, comes in a new Moroccan Blue shade and has a couple of new camera modes, including ‘AI CAM’, which allows the camera to automatically switch between eight different scenes as needed.It’s not going to convince buyers of 2017’s model to upgrade, but if you’re using something older the LG V30S ThinQ could be worth considering.Nokia 7 PlusImage 1 of 2Image 2 of 2We got a whole host of new Nokia phones at MWC 2018, with the Nokia 7 Plus being an upper mid-range model that stands out through a 6.0-inch 1080 x 2160 display with fairly slim bezels.Other highlights of the Nokia 7 Plus include the same dual-camera setup as the Nokia 8 Sirocco, meaning you get a 12MP wide-angle lens and a 13MP telephoto one. And the company claims you’ll get two days of life from the 7 Plus’s 3,800mAh battery.The rest of the specs are a bit more mid-range, with the Nokia 7 Plus being powered by a Snapdragon 660 chipset and 4GB of RAM, but given that it’s priced at AU$749 (around £350, $490) that spec mix seems pretty reasonable.The Zenfone Max Plus M1 combines a 5.7-inch 18:9 display with a massive 4,130mAh battery and a small chassis. The specs are otherwise mid-range, but it comes in at just $229 (about £164, AU$291).Image 2 of 4The Nokia 1As for the Nokia 1, that’s almost as cheap as a smartphone gets at $85 / AU$149 (around £60). The specs are predictably basic for that money, but it has a compact 4.5-inch display, a 5MP camera, a removable 2,150mAh battery, and – based on our hands-on impressions – seemingly functional performance, thanks to its use of Android One Go.Image 3 of 4The Alcatel 5Then there’s the Alcatel 5, which comes in at a fairly affordable €229.99 (about $280, £200, AU$360), for which you get an almost bezel-free 5.7-inch 720 x 1440 display, a metal shell and a dual-lens camera. There’s even facial recognition.Image 4 of 4The ZTE Blade V9Finally, there’s the ZTE Blade V9, which packs a similar price of €269 (around $330, £235, AU$420). This has an ‘Aurora Glass’ back that shimmers in the light, plus a 5.7-inch 1080 x 2160 display with small bezels, up to 4GB of RAM and a dual-lens camera, though only a fairly low-end Snapdragon 450 chipset.MWC (Mobile World Congress) is the world's largest exhibition for the mobile industry, stuffed full of the newest phones, tablets, wearables and more.

10008,3938718,2018-03-02 08:00:11,"Confronting real fears in virtual realitySharesI'm not good with heights. Sweaty hands, tunnel vision … when I get more than 10 feet off the ground, I start to lose my head. As someone who loves hiking, mountains and sprawling city panoramas, that’s a problem. So when Lithuanian software company TeleSoftas offered to cure my acrophobia at MWC 2018 using an HTC Vive, I was intrigued.When they told me that my 'inner child' would be taking me to the top of One World Trade Center in New York, I was confused.Premiering in Barcelona, TeleSoftas' Inner Child VR demo has been designed as a tool for psychotherapists. Part of the problem with treating any kind of mental issue is that psychologists have to ask their patients to imagine being in the situation they fear, or put them in that scenario, where they could be in danger. VR is therefore an appealing alternative; no imagining needed, and no one falls off a building.""It's actually not for those with a fear of heights, it’s for those with a more extreme phobia of heights,"" says Audrone Miskinyte, associate professor in clinical psychology at the University of Bergen (UiB) and Vilniaus Universitetas, who will soon be using Inner Child VR in her daily work as a psychotherapist. The first is basically a fear of falling, the other is an illogical aversion to heights that has a physiological trigger. ""It's exposure therapy where we control the environment, where the patient can be exposed to what they're afraid of.""Inner Child VR takes place within a a steel rectangle surrounded by a handrail. After donning a headset and a pair of biometric gloves strapped with trackers, the patient appears to be standing on a platform. New York can be seen all around, and crucially, below through a lattice floor. The goal is to get to the end of the walkway … with the help of a child avatar that is programmed to loosely resemble the patient.""What's new here is that we're using a child avatar,"" says Miskinyte. It's the first-ever project that applies the principles of 'transactional analysis' theory of the 'free inner child ego state'. The child resembles how the patient was before they got older, and developed irrational phobias. ""We have a child, adult and parent position, and we identify with the child,"" explains Miskinyte. ""It's natural, spontaneous, curious, and fun-seeking, and this kind of child can help us overcome our biggest fears – the child can set an example, can encourage, and can distract, and help us overcome our fear."" When running the scenario, a psychotherapist can control everything the child does and says to get the patient to move to the end of the walkway.So how did I do? Really well. ""I am you when you were little,"" says my inner child avatar at the beginning of the experience. ""We're going somewhere fun,"" he says as it becomes obvious that we’re in an elevator. The doors open and … woah! A fabulous-looking lower Manhattan is there all around, and hundreds of feet below. It's a genuinely dizzying feeling, and the first step was hard to take. ""Look at that boat!"" says the child, distracting me when I stop mid-way to my goal. However, I did eventually follow him right to the end. Halfway through the experience a helicopter arrived, and through a megaphone asked us to wave for a photo. ""I have to go now … think of me when you're scared of heights!"" says the kid as he walks off the platform.Bizarrely, the child started singing 'The Wheels On The Bus' near the end of the experience. ""I made him sing to you, and we sent the helicopter in,"" says Vytautas Kemesis, chief technology officer (CTO) at Telesoftas, from behind a screen showing a third-person view. ""We can control what the kid does and says when you need distractions or instructions.""Within seconds there's a readout of my biometrics – including a slightly elevated heart rate – and a heat-map of where I was looking. ""Most people look down,"" says Kemesis. I mainly looked at the view … though always with sweaty hands on a handrail.Inner Child VR was built using 3D game engine Unity, and TeleSoftas has plans for other VR experiences to cure other anxieties and phobias, such as spiders, flying, and public speaking.MWC (Mobile World Congress) is the world's largest exhibition for the mobile industry, stuffed full of the newest phones, tablets, wearables and more.

10009,3938790,2018-03-03 02:14:26,"About TNWTNW SitesFox triggers its own audience with misleading viral videoA recent Fox News video showed just how easy it is to spin the wheels on whatever apparatus it is that turns the outrage machine. Tucker Carlson last week aired a segment deriding “the liberal effort” to ban the word “man” on college campuses.In just under a week, it’s been shared over 486,000 times and viewed by more than 42 million people. The outrage was real. The subject matter? Not so much.Carlson didn’t lie, per se, but things got interesting when the network stripped the bit of context and slapped it on social media with the headline:Liberals have found their new target. They want to remove all ‘MAN’ words.For several minutes, Carlson and his guest Cathy Arey, founder of Catalina Magazine, held what appeared to be a mock debate featuring the smug and patronizing TV host, a man who operated in hypotheticals and condescension, like this gem: “What if you live in Manchester, Vermont?” And on the other, there was Areu, who was less offended liberal, and more SNL parody of one.The segment centered around a Purdue writing guide’s suggestion that students use inclusive and neutral language in their work. Nowhere does it suggest banning words, or avoiding usage of “man,” in anywhere but its most dated usages.“Mailman,” for example, should be “mail carrier,” as carrier’s are both male and female now. The guide is less a burning source of liberal outrage and more of a public manifesto on how not to be an asshole.Take this example:Incorrect: Although she was a blonde, Mary was still intelligent.Correct: Mary was intelligent.Painting this as a liberal issue, or an institutional one, is overlooking similar rules from guides that existed decades before Carlson’s segment. AP Stylebook, the Chicago Manual of Style, and the MLA Style Guide all have similar passages about how to use gender in writing. There isn’t a professional writer on the planet who hasn’t had to make decisions on how best to use gender in prose.The Associated Press Stylebook’s section gender-specific pronounsCarlson and his guest also ignored further context of the guide, which sought to neutralize gender in writing for both sexes, not just men. “Stewardess” and “Steward” for example, should be “flight attendant,” noting changes in the industry since the 60s when females were responsible for most in-flight care. Others seek to avoid additional wording, such as referring to a “male nurse” or a “female doctor” as “nurse” or “doctor,” respectively.Of those that specifically mentioned the word man it offered other man words as substitutions. “Mankind,” for example, could be substituted to “humanity.” “Man’s achievements” might sound better as “human achievements.”None of the real examples mesh well with Carlson’s spin on the story, but it didn’t matter. In mere hours conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones pounced on the opportunity to retell it, as did numerous fly-by-night conservative Facebook Pages — the same type used to create confusion during the 2016 election.One part, however, I couldn’t help but chuckle at. Toward the end, Carlson says:I guess the question for me is who gets to decide what changes and what doesn’t? So, for example, I think I’ve now decided the most offensive word in the language is ‘college professor,’ okay? Because to me that connotes dumbness, and misuse of power, and tenure, and mediocrity.",Fox triggers its own audience with latest misleading viral video

10011,3938792,2018-03-02 22:30:20,"About TNWTNW SitesJack calls in reinforcements to measure Twitter’s toxicityTwitter’s CEO has officially waved the white flag and called for outside help fixing the site’s toxicity. Specifically, he’s asked for help defining a metric of “conversational health” on Twitter.While it’s good to see Twitter attempt to find a system for controlling the behavior of its users, human beings are too complicated to be algorithmically guided into playing nice.It’s no secret that Twitter has, in recent months, been forced to face its epidemic of negativity, from Russian bots to the spread of fake news. Obviously, now’s the time for contrition and public vows to fix its business. CEO Jack Dorsey delivered this week with an unexpected tweetstorm laying out his feelings on the situation and his call to action:We’re committing Twitter to help increase the collective health, openness, and civility of public conversation, and to hold ourselves publicly accountable towards progress.To that end, he’s asked for help coming up with “health metrics” which will gauge the quality of the site’s conversation. He cites as an example (but not a guideline) Cortico’s metrics for “shared attention, shared reality, variety of opinion, and receptivity.” Basically, that measures whether enough people with different opinions are citing the same facts, talking to each other, and listening.I understand why Jack’s looking for measurable data to work with. It’s got to be tricky trying to find a way to get several million people to play nice with each other without censoring any person or group in particular. While it’s productive for Twitter to try and hold itself accountable, it’s asking for statistical, data-driven help with a problem that’s primarily philosophical in nature.What we know is we must commit to a rigorous and independently vetted set of metrics to measure the health of public conversation on Twitter. And we must commit to sharing our results publicly to benefit all who serve the public conversation.Suppose Twitter imposes a social media conversational health metric on a particular account. The metric says the account isn’t healthy because it retweets fake news bot tweets, or something similar. What do you do? Ban that account? Would metrics even be limited to certain accounts? Key words? If a site-wide metric said health was suffering, would Twitter go on a purge to find the offending accounts and punish them? What if someone deliberately set out to game the system — how could Twitter control for that?Human beings sometimes don’t get along. That sounds flip to say when the difficulties of social media cause the arguments to be writ large across the internet. But even if Twitter were to find a metric that told it users were all talking about the same thing and using the right keywords, there’d still be arguments, instigators, and trolls.I think, if Twitter actually buckled down and set to work removing bots and handling reports of abuse and TOS violations in a more timely manner — either through better automation or a more robust workforce — it might start to see the site get a little cleaner without having to compile data sets and metrics that could possibly be manipulated.It’s a messy process, punishing people who might turn around and complain that they’re being treated poorly. But that’s a much more understandable way of diffusing an argument between humans than relying on data that might not translate well into real-world actions.TNW 2018 is almost here, and we’ll be discussing social media and the balance of power in the age of tech.

So let’s worry about them, but let’s worry about them in a while.That’s not exactly comforting.Rapid advances in artificial intelligence and robotics have amplified the discussion in recent years. With an entire generation raised on science fiction movies depicting robot uprisings, it’s a near-certainty that these are exactly the sort of scenarios we imagine when thinking about the future of robots.And it’s certainly plausible, but not likely.Schmidt goes on to say:The other point that I want to remind everyone, these technologies have serious errors in them, and they should not be used with life-critical decisions. So I would not want to be in an airplane where the computer was making all the general intelligence decisions about flying it. The technology is just not reliable enough ― there too many errors in its use. It is advisory, it makes you smarter and so forth, but I wouldn’t put it in charge of command and control.That last sentence is key.Researchers understand, even if most of us don’t, that AI isn’t as suited to replace humans as it is to augment them. The human brain is complex. And while the average 40-year-old can’t memorize Wikipedia or beat the best poker players, the typical robot can’t handle the simple improvisation that humans excel at.In fact, most of what AI and robots are good at is menial task work, simple and repeatable objectives that are both easy to define and measure. Robots aren’t all that good at improvising; they need a defined set of rules and those rules will increasingly need to include failsafe measures to shut the machine down in periods of failure.And while these technologies will continue to improve, sentience isn’t anywhere on the horizon. For a robot to be dangerous, it has to be programmed to be dangerous. So it’s not robots we should fear, but the humans responsible for writing their code.If you’re looking for a more plausible scenario, it’s this: readers hurling themselves into the nearest body of water after another joke about the latest advancement at Boston Dynamics as the one that will ultimately be responsible for our deaths.",Ex-Google CEO is relatively certain robots aren't going to kill us for another decade or two

Today’s robots might be better suited for sewing clothes and building cars, but tomorrow’s could be as indispensable and ubiquitous as our smartphones are.A group of researchers in Europe recently published a white paper unveiling their experiments in teaching robots to anticipate human movements. The team’s work, to create “robots that can predict human actions and intent, and understand human non-verbal cues,” could pave the way for innumerable advances in the field.The researchers focused on combining previous research teaching AI to understand human gaze and pose, both of which are crucial for robots to understand in order for them to work with humans.According to the team:Situations where fast cooperation is essential, for example cooperative assembly, require the understanding of subtle non-verbal cues about the human intention and future action. In these scenarios it is not enough to merely recognize the current action. Instead, it is fundamental to predict actions and anticipate the intent in order to guarantee seamless cooperation.Using black box AI in the form of a recurrent neural network (RNN), the machines learn to determine the “intent” of a person based on where they’re looking (gaze) and the pose of their body. Whenever it gets things right, it transfers its newfound “knowledge” through the various layers in its RNN where the data is then normalized.This creepy robot, used in the research, is learning to predict what people will do next.These machines learn to predict what humans will do next by guessing. If given a limited amount of tasks, these machines could become incredibly accurate in a relatively short amount of time.According to the paper:We assume a leader-follower paradigm where the robot chooses his action as a function of the possible next human actions and the humans actions are not influenced by the robots action choice.It would be incredible if we had robots that could seamlessly zip in and out of our lives as we work and play. With finely tuned AI these machines could move among us, without causing the slightest disturbance, able to deal with our mercurial human nature by predicting what we’ll do next instead of reacting.Of course, if you believe Elon Musk, we’re just a few years away from machines that can move faster than the human-eye.This is nothing. In a few years, that bot will move so fast you’ll need a strobe light to see it. Sweet dreams… https://t.co/0MYNixQXMw",Robots can predict what you'll do next now.

10014,3939281,2018-03-03 12:10:34,"Four days with the Samsung Galaxy S9: great biometrics and enjoyable AR EmojiMore early impressions of the new GalaxySharesIt’s now a few days since we unboxed what could be one of the biggest phones of 2018, and we’re now getting to grips with the new handset and the features it offers.If you’ve not been keeping up so far, let’s have a quick recap of the Samsung Galaxy S9. Design-wise, things are almost identical to the Galaxy S8, but it’s under the hood that things are a little different.There’s far more power than last year, AR Emojis created from a single snap of your face to be used on social media, and an all-powerful camera that’s supposed to be excellent at low-light and slow motion video.We’ve been giving these features a good test each days, and we’re slowly forming a few impressions ahead of our in-depth review, which is coming up soon.AR Emoji - not uselessWe’ve been playing the most with AR Emoji, because it’s the most novel feature on the phone compared to previous models. We set up ours four days ago, and from there we’re able to make videos through the avatar by mapping our face from the front camera, or use the generated GIFs that the phone instantly creates.We’ve found that we’re using the GIFs regularly, and that if you’re using the default Samsung keyboard you’ve instantly got access to said little moving pictures of you (not in the apps themselves, as previously thought).However, we’ve not been bothered to use the video recording feature of the avatar, simply because it’s not as accurate as we’d like, leading to a lot of flickery facial features, and the angle not being quite right.If it was more accurate, then it’d probably be more of a fun feature, but we can see it falling into the realm of ‘oh, I forgot that was on the phone…’.Camera hasn't wowed... yetThe camera on the Samsung Galaxy S9 has just been awarded the top DxOMark on the market, besting the Google Pixel 2, so we’re hoping to get some stunning photos from it - especially in low light.We’ve not sat down and done any of our standard in-depth testing so far with the camera so far - it’s been largely candid snaps - but there’s not been anything mind-blowing so far that’s come from the camera.The issue is not with the quality of the photos - they’re excellent - but as smartphone photography has improved massively in the last few years, we’re getting used to smashing snaps from our handsets.Image 1 of 4The automatic 'depth of field capture' intelligence is impressive.Image 2 of 4This is in extreme low light, and yet the level of noise is so, so lowImage 3 of 4In a brighter room, we were hoping for a more dynamic picture of the fireImage 4 of 4This scene was actually brighter than we could see with our eyes.However, we did start trying the phone on Pro mode, where you can manually flip between f/1.5 and f/2.4 apertures… and if you look at the lens, you’ll even see the sensor changing in size as the mechanical shutter comes down and reduces the size of the aperture.There’s a marked difference between the two modes, and it’s something we’re looking forward to testing in real depth soon.We’ve not tested the battery so far, as we always wait for it to settle a little before doing any in-depth benchmarks, but it’s still nice to see the Galaxy S9 is checking for any apps that are munching too much power and asking if we want to shut them down.SloMo camera isn't obviousThe SloMo camera is proving trickier to use than we anticipated. The thing about introducing new features like this is that they’re not something that we’re all desperate to use - rather, we found we needed to remember to use it more.As a refresher, the default mode is that the camera will automatically start the slow motion mode when it notices something entering a box in the middle of the viewfinder - it can be hard to position this properly if you’re trying to shoot something like an animal, which is often a moving target.In these cases, it would be better to do things manually, or just be able to shoot the whole thing in slow motion and decide after what you wanted to make slower, but that’s not easy.We still like the idea of creating the slow-motion videos, but it’s not something that we’re totally enamored with right now.Improved biometricsWe have to say we’re incredibly impressed with the upgrade Samsung has brought with the biometric unlocking of the Galaxy S9 - the idea to fuse all the options together is a really neat one.We’ve disconnected our Smart Lock accessories (previously, our Android phones are unlocked whenever in range of our smartwatch) and yet still not been annoyed by getting into the phone… a long way from how we felt when reviewing the Galaxy S8 last year.The face unlock / iris recognition combo isn’t the fastest around, but it’s fast enough. We’ve often found the phone will unlock quicker than expected, jumping us in before we’ve read the notifications on the lock screen, and if there are times when we can’t hold the phone at the right angle to unlock, or it’s late at night, the fingerprint scanner is really accessible.Speakers are just fineWe’ve been trying out the dual speaker on the Samsung Galaxy S9 a fair bit, seeing how it fares compared to a standalone Bluetooth speaker that we’d usually be using.The volume is pretty good, although it’s not as loud as we’d like it to be… sometimes we need to hold it a little closer to us to hear a podcast when cooking, for instance. The sound quality is a touch scratchy at the louder volumes too, but it’s not uncomfortable.We’re looking forward to trying the Dolby Atmos setting on the phone too - it could be a really nice addition if it works well.",Four days with the Samsung Galaxy S9: great biometrics and enjoyable AR Emoji
10015,3941438,2018-03-01 17:09:37,"About TNWTNW SitesHow to optimize your Medium as a freelance writerWhether you’ve only been a writer for a few months or several years, you’ve probably heard of Medium. You might even already have an account on the site, but are you using it to its fullest potential?For those not familiar with Medium, it’s a free publishing platform that stands out from some other options because instead of focusing on the connections or clout you have as a writer, it emphasizes what you have to say.Because of this, many freelancers create accounts and start writing on Medium. However, they don’t often see the site as a career-boosting opportunity, and perhaps that’s because they’re not using all of Medium to their advantage.What makes it appealing to write on the site is that it has a gigantic community, which gives you a broad reach. I have found that many industries use this platform as a tool to engage their audiences and boost their brand exposure by providing informative blog entries.Also, the formatting of each post is easy to upload and read while looking professional. For instance, as a blogger, formatting codes — mostly in HTML — is a skill that I have always had to know. Unfortunately, coding your own blogs can take quite some time if you don’t excel at using it.However, with Medium’s professional setup and formatting, it’s easy to quickly add your text, edit, and publish it to your social media accounts within a matter of minutes. This is just one of Medium’s many benefits for freelancers.Below, you’ll find several more ways you can use this go-to writer site to your benefit. In addition to its easy user experience, you might find that it can promote your brand and solidify your status as a writer.Give praise and insights with the notes featureMedium offers a feature that allows you to leave a private note associated with a section of an article by another author. To use it, highlight a portion of text and then look for the lock icon and click it. If you don’t see the lock icon, the author has disabled private notes in the Settings section.A private note is a fantastic way for you to connect with other writers and give feedback that could boost their efforts. Here’s one example of a comment I made to an author:The example above that I wrote to another Medium user will alert them unless they disable their notes. Using this feature allows comments to be made for text requiring edits, such as improved clarity, revision, or expansion.This networking capability has consistently helped me enhance my posts without using time-consuming emails, adding to my productivity as a freelance author. In this way, Medium can also be used as a kind of networking site for writers that allows them to build relationships with one another.Write purposefully to expand your reachBecause Medium is a popular platform for those who appreciate writing and reading well-formed opinions, it offers abundant opportunities to become a thought leader on Medium.You can browse Medium’s themed channels and find articles related to your interests that get high levels of engagement. Then, analyze them to determine how they excel. Components like headlines and paragraph lengths could help you to make significant impacts on click-through statistics.In addition, I’ve found that it’s helpful to come up with a post frequency schedule. You should always aim for quality over quantity, and when picking topics, come up with fresh angles when possible. Don’t be afraid to express minority viewpoints, especially if you can back up opinions with scientific research.Pay attention to the referrers part of the stats sectionThe stats link in the right sidebar of the Medium interface gives information about which of your posts generate the most interest. Most people know about the views metric, which indicates how many individual visitors saw each post. However, the “Referrers” section is one you might not have investigated yet.After clicking the “Referrers” button below a story title, you’ll see a breakdown of how many viewers found your post via a particular method. With this feature, it’s easy to focus on career growth by adjusting your branding tactics for maximum reach. As an example, if it becomes apparent that half your traffic for a given story came through Twitter, that’s a definite sign you should prioritize your engagement on that platform. In contrast, if the majority of those referrals came from email links, this could indicate your newsletter is working well.Build your Medium presence without writing tons of new contentUnlike some publishing platforms, Medium does not require original posts. Instead, you can quickly add articles you wrote that initially appeared on other sites, which lets you demonstrate your capabilities as a writer.This is also a great way to send visitors to your personal blog or other outlets you write for. Just include a link back to the originally published article in your post — I do this with all of my posts for my blogs.To quickly add existing posts to Medium, click your user icon, go to the “Stories” section and choose “Import.” Paste the URL of a story into the provided field. Then, click “See Your Story” to edit it. One time-saving thing about this feature is it automatically assigns a canonical URL to the story that references the source.Want to save even more time? Medium also has a WordPress plugin that automatically syndicates your blog posts to Medium.You’ll receive payment based on the number of claps your posts get and the amount of time viewers spend reading the content.In other words, the people who pay the monthly fee use their engagement levels to influence how much money you receive. Stripe is the payment distributor, and Medium sends revenues each month.All authors can take part in the Medium Partner Program. However, you can still post free content for everyone to see. If you’re ready to try making money by writing, though, Medium’s paid opportunity is a good start for taking your career in that direction.Give some of your Medium stories a creative commons licenseMedium lets content creators license their works under any of the Creative Commons options. Those that require attribution open up the possibility for others writers or publications to share your work and grow your prominence.Some sites rely on Medium when they lack enough original content. So, Creative Commons license is an easy way for writers to increase their chances of getting syndicated.To choose a license for a piece of content, view it in Edit mode. Go to the “Publish” menu, click “Scheduling/Audience/License,” then “License.” As you can see from these tips, there are strategic moves to try as a freelance writer on Medium.By experimenting with them, you may discover career benefits you hadn’t even imagined, increasing your motivation to continue improving.This post is part of our contributor series.

10016,3944221,2018-01-31 14:54:34,"Developer tipsGDPR – A Practical Guide For DevelopersYou’ve probably heard about GDPR. The new European data protection regulation that applies practically to everyone. Especially if you are working in a big company, it’s most likely that there’s already a process for getting your systems in compliance with the regulation.The regulation is basically a law that must be followed in all European countries (but also applies to non-EU companies that have users in the EU). In this particular case, it applies to companies that are not registered in Europe, but are having European customers. So that’s most companies. I will not go into yet another “12 facts about GDPR” or “7 myths about GDPR” posts/whitepapers, as they are often aimed at managers or legal people. Instead, I’ll focus on what GDPR means for developers.I’ll try to be a bit more comprehensive this time and cover as many aspects of the regulation that concern developers as I can. And while developers will mostly be concerned about how the systems they are working on have to change, it’s not unlikely that a less informed manager storms in in late spring, realizing GDPR is going to be in force tomorrow, asking “what should we do to get our system/website compliant”.The rights of the user/client (referred to as “data subject” in the regulation) that I think are relevant for developers are: the right to erasure (the right to be forgotten/deleted from the system), right to restriction of processing (you still keep the data, but mark it as “restricted” and don’t touch it without further consent by the user), the right to data portability (the ability to export one’s data in a machine-readable format), the right to rectification (the ability to get personal data fixed), the right to be informed (getting human-readable information, rather than long terms and conditions), the right of access (the user should be able to see all the data you have about them).Additionally, the relevant basic principles are: data minimization (one should not collect more data than necessary), integrity and confidentiality (all security measures to protect data that you can think of + measures to guarantee that the data has not been inappropriately modified).Even further, the regulation requires certain processes to be in place within an organization (of more than 250 employees or if a significant amount of data is processed), and those include keeping a record of all types of processing activities carried out, including transfers to processors (3rd parties), which includes cloud service providers. None of the other requirements of the regulation have an exception depending on the organization size, so “I’m small, GDPR does not concern me” is a myth.It is important to know what “personal data” is. Basically, it’s every piece of data that can be used to uniquely identify a person or data that is about an already identified person. It’s data that the user has explicitly provided, but also data that you have collected about them from either 3rd parties or based on their activities on the site (what they’ve been looking at, what they’ve purchased, etc.)Having said that, I’ll list a number of features that will have to be implemented and some hints on how to do that, followed by some do’s and don’t’s.“Forget me” – you should have a method that takes a userId and deletes all personal data about that user (in case they have been collected on the basis of consent or based on the legitimate interests of the controller (see more below), and not due to contract enforcement or legal obligation). It is actually useful for integration tests to have that feature (to cleanup after the test), but it may be hard to implement depending on the data model. In a regular data model, deleting a record may be easy, but some foreign keys may be violated. That means you have two options – either make sure you allow nullable foreign keys (for example an order usually has a reference to the user that made it, but when the user requests his data be deleted, you can set the userId to null), or make sure you delete all related data (e.g. via cascades). This may not be desirable, e.g. if the order is used to track available quantities or for accounting purposes. It’s a bit trickier for event-sourcing data models, or in extreme cases, ones that include some sort of blockchain/hash chain/tamper-evident data structure. With event sourcing you should be able to remove a past event and re-generate intermediate snapshots. For blockchain-like structures – be careful what you put in there and avoid putting personal data of users. There is an option to use a chameleon hash function, but that’s suboptimal. Overall, you must constantly think of how you can delete the personal data. And “our data model doesn’t allow it” isn’t an excuse. What about backups? Ideally, you should keep a separate table of forgotten user IDs, so that each time you restore a backup, you re-forget the forgotten users. This means the table should be in a separate database or have a separate backup/restore process.Notify 3rd parties for erasure – deleting things from your system may be one thing, but you are also obligated to inform all third parties that you have pushed that data to. So if you have sent personal data to, say, Salesforce, Hubspot, twitter, or any cloud service provider, you should call an API of theirs that allows for the deletion of personal data. If you are such a provider, obviously, your “forget me” endpoint should be exposed. Calling the 3rd party APIs to remove data is not the full story, though. You also have to make sure the information does not appear in search results. Now, that’s tricky, as Google doesn’t have an API for removal, only a manual process. Fortunately, it’s only about public profile pages that are crawlable by Google (and other search engines, okay…), but you still have to take measures. Ideally, you should make the personal data page return a 404 HTTP status, so that it can be removed.Restrict processing – in your admin panel where there’s a list of users, there should be a button “restrict processing”. The user settings page should also have that button. When clicked (after reading the appropriate information), it should mark the profile as restricted. That means it should no longer be visible to the backoffice staff, or publicly. You can implement that with a simple “restricted” flag in the users table and a few if-clasues here and there.Export data – there should be another button – “export data”. When clicked, the user should receive all the data that you hold about them. What exactly is that data – depends on the particular usecase. Usually it’s at least the data that you delete with the “forget me” functionality, but may include additional data (e.g. the orders the user has made may not be delete, but should be included in the dump). The structure of the dump is not strictly defined, but my recommendation would be to reuse schema.org definitions as much as possible, for either JSON or XML. If the data is simple enough, a CSV/XLS export would also be fine. Sometimes data export can take a long time, so the button can trigger a background process, which would then notify the user via email when his data is ready (twitter, for example, does that already – you can request all your tweets and you get them after a while). You don’t need to implement an automated export, although it would be nice. It’s sufficient to have a process in place to allow users to request their data, which can be a manual database-querying process.Allow users to edit their profile – this seems an obvious rule, but it isn’t always followed. Users must be able to fix all data about them, including data that you have collected from other sources (e.g. using a “login with facebook” you may have fetched their name and address). Rule of thumb – all the fields in your “users” table should be editable via the UI. Technically, rectification can be done via a manual support process, but that’s normally more expensive for a business than just having the form to do it. There is one other scenario, however, when you’ve obtained the data from other sources (i.e. the user hasn’t provided their details to you directly). In that case there should still be a page where they can identify somehow (via email and/or sms confirmation) and get access to the data about them.Consent checkboxes – “I accept the terms and conditions” would no longer be sufficient to claim that the user has given their consent for processing their data. So, for each particular processing activity there should be a separate checkbox on the registration (or user profile) screen. You should keep these consent checkboxes in separate columns in the database, and let the users withdraw their consent (by unchecking these checkboxes from their profile page – see the previous point). Ideally, these checkboxes should come directly from the register of processing activities (if you keep one). Note that the checkboxes should not be preselected, as this does not count as “consent”. Another important thing here is machine learning/AI. If you are going to use the user’s data to train your ML models, you should get consent for that as well (unless it’s for scientific purposes, which have special treatment in the regulation). Note here the so called “legitimate interest”. It is for the legal team to decide what a legitimate interest is, but direct marketing is included in that category, as well as any common sense processing relating to the business activity – e.g. if you collect addresses for shipping, it’s obviously a legitimate interest. So not all processing activities need consent checkboxes.Re-request consent – if the consent users have given was not clear (e.g. if they simply agreed to terms & conditions), you’d have to re-obtain that consent. So prepare a functionality for mass-emailing your users to ask them to go to their profile page and check all the checkboxes for the personal data processing activities that you have.“See all my data” – this is very similar to the “Export” button, except data should be displayed in the regular UI of the application rather than an XML/JSON format. I wouldn’t say this is mandatory, and you can leave it as a “desirable” feature – for example, Google Maps shows you your location history – all the places that you’ve been to. It is a good implementation of the right to access. (Though Google is very far from perfect when privacy is concerned). This is not all about the right to access – you have to let unregistered users ask whether you have data about them, but that would be a more manual process. The ideal minimum would be to have a feature “check by email”, where you check if you have data about a particular email. You also need to tell the user in what ways you are processing their data. You can simply print all the records in your data process register for which the user has consented to.Age checks – you should ask for the user’s age, and if the user is a child (below 16), you should ask for parent permission. There’s no clear way how to do that, but my suggestion is to introduce a flow, where the child should specify the email of a parent, who can then confirm. Obviously, children will just cheat with their birthdate, or provide a fake parent email, but you will most likely have done your job according to the regulation (this is one of the “wishful thinking” aspects of the regulation).Keeping data for no longer than necessary – if you’ve collected the data for a specific purpose (e.g. shipping a product), you have to delete it/anonymize it as soon as you don’t need it. Many e-commerce sites offer “purchase without registration”, in which case the consent goes only for the particular order. So you need a scheduled job/cron to periodically go through the data and anonymize it (delete names and addresses), but only after a certain condition is met – e.g. the product is confirmed as delivered. You can have a database field for storing the deadline after which the data should be gone, and that deadline can be extended in case of a delivery problem.Now some “do’s”, which are mostly about the technical measures needed to protect personal data (outlined in article 32). They may be more “ops” than “dev”, but often the application also has to be extended to support them. I’ve listed most of what I could think of in a previous post. An important note here is that this is not mandated by the regulation, but it’s a good practice anyway and helps with protecting personal data.Encrypt the data in transit. That means that communication between your application layer and your database (or your message queue, or whatever component you have) should be over TLS. The certificates could be self-signed (and possibly pinned), or you could have an internal CA. Different databases have different configurations, just google “X encrypted connections. Some databases need gossiping among the nodes – that should also be configured to use encryptionEncrypt the data at rest – this again depends on the database (some offer table-level encryption), but can also be done on machine-level. E.g. using LUKS. The private key can be stored in your infrastructure, or in some cloud service like AWS KMS.Encrypt your backups – kind of obviousImplement pseudonymisation – the most obvious use-case is when you want to use production data for the test/staging servers. You should change the personal data to some “pseudonym”, so that the people cannot be identified. When you push data for machine learning purposes (to third parties or not), you can also do that. Technically, that could mean that your User object can have a “pseudonymize” method which applies hash+salt/bcrypt/PBKDF2 for some of the data that can be used to identify a person. Pseudonyms could be reversible or not, depending on the usecase (the definition in the regulation implies reversibility based on a secret information, but in the case of test/staging data it might not be). Some databases have such features built-in, e.g. Orale.Protect data integrity – this is a very broad thing, and could simply mean “have authentication mechanisms for modifying data”. But you can do something more, even as simple as a checksum, or a more complicated solution (like the one I’m working on). It depends on the stakes, on the way data is accessed, on the particular system, etc. The checksum can be in the form of a hash of all the data in a given database record, which should be updated each time the record is updated through the application. It isn’t a strong guarantee, but it is at least something.Have your GDPR register of processing activities in something other than Excel – Article 30 says that you should keep a record of all the types of activities that you use personal data for. That sounds like bureaucracy, but it may be useful – you will be able to link certain aspects of your application with that register (e.g. the consent checkboxes, or your audit trail records). It wouldn’t take much time to implement a simple register, but the business requirements for that should come from whoever is responsible for the GDPR compliance. But you can advise them that having it in Excel won’t make it easy for you as a developer (imagine having to fetch the excel file internally, so that you can parse it and implement a feature). Such a register could be a microservice/small application deployed separately in your infrastructure.Log access to personal data – every read operation on a personal data record should be logged, so that you know who accessed what and for what purpose. This does not follow directly from the provisions of the regulation, but it is kinda implied from the accountability principles. What about search results (or lists) that contain personal data about multiple subjects? My hunch is that simply logging “user X did a search for criteria Y” would suffice. But don’t display too many personal data in lists – for example see how facebook makes you go through some hoops to get a person’s birthday. Note: some have treated article 30 as a requirement to keep an audit log. I don’t think it is saying that – instead it requires 250+ companies (or companies processing data regularly) to keep a register of the types of processing activities (i.e. what you use the data for). There are other articles in the regulation that imply that keeping an audit log is a best practice (for protecting the integrity of the data as well as to make sure it hasn’t been processed without a valid reason)Register all API consumers – you shouldn’t allow anonymous API access to personal data. I’d say you should request the organization name and contact person for each API user upon registration, and add those to the data processing register.Finally, some “don’t’s”.Don’t use data for purposes that the user hasn’t agreed with – that’s supposed to be the spirit of the regulation. If you want to expose a new API to a new type of clients, or you want to use the data for some machine learning, or you decide to add ads to your site based on users’ behaviour, or sell your database to a 3rd party – think twice. I would imagine your register of processing activities could have a button to send notification emails to users to ask them for permission when a new processing activity is added (or if you use a 3rd party register, it should probably give you an API). So upon adding a new processing activity (and adding that to your register), mass email all users from whom you’d like consent. Note here that additional legitimate interests of the controller might be added dynamically.Don’t log personal data – getting rid of the personal data from log files (especially if they are shipped to a 3rd party service) can be tedious or even impossible. So log just identifiers if needed. And make sure old logs files are cleaned up, just in caseDon’t put fields on the registration/profile form that you don’t need – it’s always tempting to just throw as many fields as the usability person/designer agrees on, but unless you absolutely need the data for delivering your service, you shouldn’t collect it. Names you should probably always collect, but unless you are delivering something, a home address or phone is unnecessary.Don’t assume 3rd parties are compliant – you are responsible if there’s a data breach in one of the 3rd parties (e.g. “processors”) to which you send personal data. So before you send data via an API to another service, make sure they have at least a basic level of data protection. If they don’t, raise a flag with management.Don’t assume having ISO XXX makes you compliant – information security standards and even personal data standards are a good start and they will probably 70% of what the regulation requires, but they are not sufficient – most of the things listed above are not covered in any of those standardsOverall, the purpose of the regulation is to make you take conscious decisions when processing personal data. It imposes best practices in a legal way. If you follow the above advice and design your data model, storage, data flow , API calls with data protection in mind, then you shouldn’t worry about the huge fines that the regulation prescribes – they are for extreme cases, like Equifax for example. Regulators (data protection authorities) will most likely have some checklists into which you’d have to somehow fit, but if you follow best practices, that shouldn’t be an issue.I think all of the above features can be implemented in a few weeks by a small team. Be suspicious when a big vendor offers you a generic plug-and-play “GDPR compliance” solution. GDPR is not just about the technical aspects listed above – it does have organizational/process implications. But also be suspicious if a consultant claims GDPR is complicated. It’s not – it relies on a few basic principles that are in fact best practices anyway. Just don’t ignore them.25 thoughts on “GDPR – A Practical Guide For Developers”Hi Bozho, Excellent article. I was wondering what your thought were on how to handle historical backups when implementing “Forget me”. Would every backup containing data on the subject need to be restored in order to delete the relevant data and then subsequently backed up again? This could be a nightmare scenario for a large company with a lot of data and a lot of forget me requests Kind Regards, DarrenI really like your article! I have just one comment which I think is worth to mention, you do not have to implement everything, if you could with high probability assume that for example right to portability will be used very rarely you could define manual process for extracting personal data from database and use it when it will be needed. I think GDPR put a requirement on data Controller to provide possibility to do so, the way is up to the controller.Further to Darren’s comment/question about right-to-erasure and backups: A similar problem also occurs when using the event sourcing architecture, if personal data is stored in an immutable event log. One option for these scenarios is to use cryptographic erasure: encrypt personal data field upfront, with a key specific to the data subject, and deleting the key when needed to enforce deletion of the data. This is something we’ve implemented for Java. More info here: https://axoniq.io/events/2017/11/gdpr-webinar.html@Darren I added a little more about backups. Basically, you keep a list of forgotten user IDs and re-delete them on restore.@Frans yes, that’s a good approach. In some cases events (in event sourcing) can be deleted or modified/anonymized without affecting anything else, so that’s also an option (slightly easier, but potentially breaking)@Albert – that’s right. It better be automated, but it doesn’t have to be. I’ll add a clarification @Dawn – yupBasically you assume, that you already have perfect data quality and have identified all persons with some account id. But the regulation never mentions some id, it requires to identify natural persons, not accounts.Some example from my real live experience with data we have seen at almost every customer companies. You have an contract with an ISP for your internet and another contract with the same ISP for your mobile phone. What we have seen is, that most of the companies create TWO seperate accounts for this and don’t get the data connected. Especially, if there are some company fusions or just different departments. The result is currently, that you might get two ad mails for a new product of the ISP.For the GDRP it would NOT be sufficent, to make some buttons after the account login, if the natural person has two accounts. You have to find ALL data regarding this one natural person. So the buttons are good, but if you don’t control your data quality you could get into trouble.So, you are right, GDPR is not THAT complicated, but it isn’t THAT easy as you say. The basic implementation for some features might only require some weeks, but only if you already have solved some very hard problems. Maybe it is quite easy for small or “new” companies, which only have ONE (at most two) database, but for most companies we talk to, this is not the reality.Just my thoughts (I work at a company with heavy experience with data(-quality)) Greetings MarcelHello Bozho, first of thank you for a comprehensive and an exhaustive article. I have a bit of an obscure question. How about third parties who generate user interaction data which is used for ROI, conversion and such measurements? Especially where they don’t explicitly or implicitly know the user ? do those 3rd parties need to provide data export for the specific user? I am asking because in order to offer an export, they’d need to be able to bind the actual app user to their user agnostic tracking system.If they can’t deduce the user, they cannot do any of the above. However, they should follow the e-privacy directive and the upcoming e-privacy regulation which defines how cookies and other tracking mechanisms are usedI think it covers the most common use cases . There will certainly be edge cases depending on the business needs that are not covered above, though. The other day we got such a question – “what to do in case we get the data of the user and their consent over the phone”. Seems like the proper thing is to just mark the consent in a CRM on behalf of the user, but it is not yet clear – maybe some call archiving will be needed in case of sensitive data? Can’t say at this point without consulting with legal experts.Thanks for sharing your analysis. I’ve spent some days in 2017 to scan official ressources, including the original GDPR text, and for some points, I came to a slightly different conclusion. Basically, almost every time you write “must” (encrypt data base content; provide a data download button; allow direct personal data editing; etc…), on my side, went to the conclusion that this is an option, not a requirement. What is required is to grant each individual access to their personal data; the how (is it automated or manually) is not enforced. Thus, a snail mail process would meet the requirement. Regarding encryption, the text states “shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk”. The notion of “level of security appropriate to the risk” is key here : whether data are usual ecommerce data (postal address) or personal insurance data (history of failures, …) does matter, and measures are to be adapted. By the way, it is not only a technical point, but also a process point : what about the developer who would code the encryption of the data : how do you ensure that he will not be able to access/decypher all data ?I was curious if GDPR only applies to client data or if it also applies to employee/admin user data as well.For example with event sourcing or access logs, would have something like “Employee X changed Customer Y’s address on 01/01/2018”. Can the employee/admin ask for their data to be forgotten? (eg when employee leaves company)What would you recommend for people who are both customers and employees?It applies to employee/admin data as well, yes, BUT it is based on contract, rather than consent. So the employee can’t ask to be forgotten. You just have to define a data retention period for that kind of audit data (it shouldn’t be “forever”)You are correct. It is more fuzzy than “must” vs “must not”. I’ve listed the general good practices that would make you safer, but whether a compliance audit will absolutely require them – depends on many factors.Great article. Helps our developers really grasp the concepts i’ve been trying to get across on our implementation journey. We are now more focused. Our real challenge is in implementing a solution for data at rest that avoids having to encrypt the whole database.Great article, I’m just in the process of ensuring GDPR compliance in our reporting databases, and one issue that we’re having is with our main Datawarehouse, in which we’ve got data from about 5 legacy systems combining, we’re finding that realistically we need to obfuscate the personal details identically for the systems, so that I’ve got the same fake name and postcode in each system (for instance) to be able to match or throw up anomalies in an exception report.Ideally, the best approach would be to start afresh with empty systems and populate each with specific test data but getting the diversity, volume and historical issues would mean the data was hugely unrealistic and at the point of going live we’d hit new unforeseen issues that the clean, sensible test data didn’t expose.Another challenge is when updating the data with live deltas, the obfuscation needs to be similarly consistent – so, for example, we’ve got me, Mr Smith, first appearing in our CRM system as a lead, so that creates a record in the warehouse and after anoymisation, I’m ‘Mr Jones’ (along with obfuscated email, phone, address etc) – then I sign up as a customer in the sales system, we have to go back to the CRM system and find my pseudonym and use that, whereas if I’ve just appeared directly in the Sales system, they’ll need to come up with a new pseudonym, randomly generated, and then later, if I appear in the CRM system (if they did a customer mailout for instance) they’ve got to do the same. Essentially, the first time I appear in any system I’m given my pseudonymous values, and appearances in subsequent systems must tie back to that first appearance. Also this needs to be done on a field by field basis, as not all systems have all the same fields – (one might have email, another not).Hi Bozho, I am not developer but a “manager” 🙂 However I would like to ask a developer type question. Is it possible that access to data within a database is granted via an API that ensures you should have access. That way developers cannot use PHP encoded into the webpage to see all data without logging their access. Thanks JamesFor me there is a contradiction between the “forget me” functionality and when you were saying you can restore the database with a backup and then erasing those users’ personal data. In my understanding this should not be enough to do compile with the regulations. Same goes for encrypting your backup, I just fail to see how is that compatible with GDPR. My understanding is that you have to delete EVERY personal information you storing about the specific person in your system. Doesnt matter if its in a log file or database or happen to be in a backup file.“Yes, but that just shifts the responsibility to the developers of the API. Ultimately someone will have to write queries”Well, yes and no. The company can get audited, so it’s not really the developer responsibility of the API. It’s the whole company, and the developer has to make the requirement efforts to compile with the regulations. And again, I don’t think leaving the user personal data in backups is compatible with GDPR. Although I don’t know a better solution neither, since every company has incremental backups and it just makes it close to impossible to do such a thing – removing personal data from those backups too -.About the API – from organizational point of view it is of course better to limit the number of people (and applications) that have direct access to the database. No doubt about it.As for backups – since eventually old backups are discarded (even in the case of incremental backups, full backups are performed), then I think you are fine with having an encrypted backup + a separate table with forgotten users. Apart from that, I agree, you can’t delete personal data from backups. It’s sufficient to acknowledge that, to protect the backups (encrypt, limit access to them), and have them expire. I guess..",GDPR - A Practical Guide For Developers - Bozho's tech blog
10017,3944222,2018-03-01 12:12:08,"We X-Rayed Some MLB Baseballs. Here’s What We Found.On 6,105 occasions last season, a major leaguer walked to the plate and hammered a baseball over the outfield wall. The 2017 season broke the home run record that was set in 2000 — the peak of the steroid era — when players hit 5,693 homers, and it built upon the remarkable 5,610 that were hit in 2016. It was a stunning display of power that played out in every MLB park almost every night. And with spring training underway in Florida and Arizona, MLB’s power surge is showing no sign of letting up.But while we now know what caused the spike in home runs at the turn of the century — even if we didn’t at the time — the reason for the most recent flurry of long balls remains an unsolved mystery. Any number of factors might have contributed to the home run surge, including bigger, stronger players or a new emphasis on hitting fly balls. But none of those possibilities looms larger than the ball itself.MLB and its commissioner, Rob Manfred, have repeatedly denied rumors that the ball has been altered in any way — or “juiced” — to generate more homers. But a large and growing body of research shows that, beginning in the middle of the 2015 season, the MLB baseball began to fly further. And new research commissioned by “ESPN Sport Science,” a show that breaks down the science of sports,1 suggests that MLB baseballs used after the 2015 All-Star Game were subtly but consistently different than older baseballs. The research, performed by the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California and Kent State University’s Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, reveals changes in the density and chemical composition of the baseball’s core — and provides our first glimpse inside the newer baseballs.Looking inside the balls and testing their chemical composition revealed that the cores of recent balls were somewhat less dense than the cores of balls used before the 2015 All-Star Game. The newer cores weigh about a half a gram less than the older ones, which might be enough to cause baseballs hit on a typical home run trajectory to fly about 6 inches farther. That alone is hardly enough to explain the home run surge of recent seasons, but when combined with previousresearchfinding that baseballs began to change in other small ways starting around the same time, it suggests that a number of minor differences may have combined to contribute to the remarkable upswing in home run power we’ve witnessed since 2015.Asked about these findings, MLB noted that it had commissioned a group of scientists and statisticians to investigate any changes to the ball, and that the committee would issue a report on its research soon. According to Alan Nathan, one of the physicists on the commission, the task force found that all the characteristics that MLB regularly measures, including the weight, circumference, seam height and bounciness of the ball, were within ranges that meant variations in the baseballs were unlikely to significantly affect home run rates. MLB declined to provide the data supporting these assertions.Independent investigations byFiveThirtyEight, publications like The Ringer, and Nathan himself have shown differences in the characteristics of the ball and the way it performs. Research has shown that balls used in games after the 2015 All-Star Game were bouncier and less air resistant compared with baseballs from the 2014 season, when players hit a relatively modest 4,186 homers, the fewest since 1995. (Nathan noted that MLB does not regularly measure air resistance.) Taken together, these changes would result in a ball that would come off the bat at a higher speed and carry farther. While investigations have been able to show that the baseball behaves differently in recent years, no one had looked inside the ball to see if there was evidence of changes to the way the baseball is constructed.So far, these investigations have primarily looked at the exterior of the baseball.Broadly, MLB baseballs — which are produced by Rawlings in Costa Rica — are made of three components: an exterior shell of cowhide, a winding of several layers of yarn, and a core of rubber-coated cork, also known as a “pill.”To analyze possible changes to the inside of the ball, particularly the core, “ESPN Sport Science” purchased one new ball from Rawlings and seven game-used baseballs from eBay, confirming their authenticity through MLB’s authenticator program.2The eight baseballs we tested were split into two groups: an “old group” of four balls used in games played between August 2014 and May 2015, and a “new group” of three balls used in games played between August 2016 and July 2017, plus the brand-new ball. The aim was to see if the internal composition of the baseballs had changed in ways that would affect the ball’s performance.3The balls were first analyzed by Dr. Meng Law, Dr. Jay Acharya and Darryl Hwang at the Keck School of Medicine at USC using a computerized tomography, or CT, scan. This test is typically used to look inside a human head or body, but in this case, it allowed Dr. Law’s team to examine the interior of the baseballs without cracking them open and destroying them.Initial CT imaging showed that baseballs in the same group had a negligible variation in internal properties.When comparing the new and old groups, however, there was a clear difference in the density of the core.In an MLB baseball, the core consists of four parts: a cork pellet at the center, surrounded by a layer of black rubber held together by a rubber ring where the halves meet, all of which is then molded together in a layer of pink rubber.Dr. Law’s team isolated the density difference to the outer (pink) layer of the core, which was, on average, about 40 percent less dense in the new group of balls.While other parts of the ball showed slight differences in density and volume, none were as noteworthy as the changes to the core.It’s not just that the inside of the ball looks different — the chemical composition of the cores appears to have changed as well. After being tested at the Keck School, the same set of balls were sent to Kent State University. There, researchers at Soumitra Basu’s lab in the Chemistry and Biochemistry department cut open the balls to examine the cores using a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). This test essentially cooks a material to see which parts parts of it vaporize at which temperatures. Using that information, researchers can create a molecular profile of a given material.This test showed that the pink layer of the core in baseballs from the new group was, on average, composed of about 7 percent more polymer than the same area in baseballs from the old group. Additionally, an analysis with a scanning electron microscope showed that the same layer in the new balls contained, on average, 10 percent less silicon, relative to the amount of other ingredients in the pill. According to the Kent State researchers, these chemical changes produced a more porous, less dense layer of rubber — which explains the results seen in the CT scan at the Keck School.It may not seem obvious, but these slight changes in the chemical composition of the core could have an impact on how the balls played once they were sewn up and shipped to major league teams. Less dense cores could mean lighter baseballs. The cores of the new balls weighed, on average, about 0.5 grams less than the cores from the old group. This difference was statistically significant, which means it’s highly unlikely that it was due to sampling error. The overall weight of the balls also dropped by an average of about a 0.5 grams between groups, but, unlike with the cores, this difference was not statistically significant.4Half a gram isn’t much — it’s only about the weight of a paperclip. A tiny change like this might add only about 6 inches to flight of a baseball hit on a typical home run trajectory, according to Nathan’s calculations. But the timing of these changes to the weight and density of the core coincides with a much larger boost to the bounciness of the baseball. According to a previous analysis performed by The Ringer, that increase in bounciness alone would add around 0.6 mph to the speed of the ball as it leaves the bat and add roughly 3 feet to the travel distance of a fly ball — enough to make the difference between the warning track and the stands.On top of the fact that the balls became bouncier as the core itself changed, previous research at FiveThirtyEight showed that they also became less air resistant. The decrease in drag is probably a result of a smaller, slicker baseball with lower seams. The change in air resistance could add an additional 5 feet to the travel distance of a fly ball. Combine all these factors together — a lighter, more compact baseball with tighter seams and more bounce — and the ball could fly as much as 8.6 feet farther. According to Nathan’s calculations, this would lead to a more than 25 percent increase in the number of home runs. Asked whether these changes in combination could have significantly affected the home run rate, MLB declined to comment.In actuality, home runs spiked by about 46 percent between 2014 and 2017, which means that the changes to the ball could account for more than half of the increase. The remainder could be reasonably chalked up to a philosophical shift among MLB hitters, who are likely swinging upward to maximize the number of balls they hit in the air and are not shy about the increase in strikeouts that may come with that approach.MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has repeatedlydenied that the baseball is juiced. On numerous occasions, he has said league testing found that baseballs continue to fall within the range that MLB designates as acceptable, and he recently said that MLB testing showed the balls to be fundamentally the same. But even if the baseballs still meet the league’s manufacturing guidelines, their performance could change enough to double (or, theoretically, halve) the number of home runs hit in a year.In fact, in January of 2015, Rawlings filed a patent application for a manufacturing process that would allow it to produce softballs and non-MLB baseballs5 that were as bouncy as possible while still falling within the manufacturing specifications set by the league. This type of ball is constructed quite differently from MLB baseballs, so there’s no indication that this patent means Rawlings is deliberately manipulating major league baseballs in this way, but it demonstrates that it’s at least theoretically possible for balls to be “fundamentally the same” while also performing differently than they have in the past.Kathy Smith-Stephens, senior director of quality and compliance at Rawlings, said that no change had been made to the baseballs but that “natural variation” occurs in the manufacturing process. She noted that they “continuously tweak” — though later in the interview she asked that we say “continuously refine” — the manufacturing process in an effort to reduce variations, but said that Rawlings’ internal testing had shown no difference in the ball’s weight or bounciness.Evidence that the baseball is at least partially responsible for the last few years’ spike in the home run rate mounted throughout the summer of 2017 and reached a peak during October’s World Series. In those seven games, the Houston Astros and Los Angeles Dodgers smashed 24 homers, including eight in one game. In the wake of this power display, Manfred asked all 30 teams to start storing baseballs in a climate-controlled room and commissioned a task force of scientists and statisticians to investigate whether the ball was juiced in 2017. Our own research, combined with controlled tests from three separate academic laboratories, strongly suggests that the physical properties of the ball have changed. Taken together, all these studies give us a lot of evidence to suggest that today’s baseballs differ in meaningful ways from those of a few years ago. In other words, there are many questions for Manfred’s committee to address.Special thanks to Sean O’Rourke, Dr. Cynthia Bir and Nathan Beals for additional research assistance.FootnotesESPN owns FiveThirtyEight.Contractors working for MLB affix a tamper-resistant hologram sticker to balls that they personally witness being used in the game. The sticker includes a serial number that can be entered into the MLB authenticator program to confirm that the ball is real and to find out which game it was used in.This sample is admittedly small, but according to the Kent State scientists we worked with, it’s sufficient to determine statistical significance in the two groups.The ball as a whole weighs much more than the core alone, and there was more variation in the weight of the full baseballs than in the weight of the cores, both of which meant that the bar for statistically significant variations in weight was higher for the whole baseball than for just the core.The patent applies to balls with foam cores, which might be used in softball or youth-league baseball, for example, but does not apply to the type of baseballs used in MLB, with layers of yarn around a cork-and-rubber core.Rob Arthur is FiveThirtyEight’s baseball columnist and also writes about crime. @No_Little_PlansTim Dix is a writer based in Los Angeles, where he mostly produces television programming involving sports or science or both.",We X-Rayed Some MLB Baseballs.

10018,3944467,2018-03-02 14:49:44,"TNW SitesVoice assistants aren’t built for kids — we need to fix thatVoice assistants have recently made the leap from your personal smart device into the home via home devices, such as Amazon Alexa or Google Home. It’s been estimated that 39 million Americans now own a voice-activated smart home speaker. These assistants are now being integrated into other smart devices in the home such as TVs, lights, fridges, headphones, etc.It’s clear that voice as an interface has suddenly gone mainstream and we are regularly seeing advertisements of families enjoying and interacting with their home devices. But as voice interactions become ubiquitous in the home, I think there’s an important question we need to ask ourselves: “Are these voice interfaces appropriate for children?”Like you might expect, there’s no simple answer to that question. However, we can get closer to an answer by looking at a few key aspects of this issue that must be addressed.Systems must engage with kids appropriatelyFirstly, the system must respond appropriately to children. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders recently called out Amazon after she claimed that her two-year-old child was able to use the Echo to purchase an $80 Batman toy. It‘s worth noting that simply calling out the word ‘batman,’ even repeatedly, is not going to purchase batman for you on Amazon; the UI simply doesn’t work that way. However, it does highlight an interesting issue; that home devices should not allow children to access the same environments as adults.Alexa is not alone in her indiscriminate behavior. My eight-year-old was recently using Siri on my phone and the word ‘bitch’ appeared. Note that she had not actually said the word, which speaks more to its poor accuracy for kids voices. Shocked, she showed me the phone. While Siri did reply with an amusing ‘there’s no need for that,’ Siri should have identified that this was a child speaking and responded appropriately, choosing to not print the obscenity to the screen.For voice assistants to work accurately and appropriately, they must be able to identify children’s voices and create, implement, and adhere to proper protocols in regards to how they handle requests. Otherwise we’ll just get more of incidents like this:Privacy and data protection for kids’ voice dataSecondly, children’s voice data must be processed and stored in accordance with data privacy and protection laws globally. This throws up many more challenges which so far, seem to have been mostly pushed aside. We need to understand more about how our children’s data is being used and stored.The FTC’s Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) dictates how operators must handle personally identifiable information, such as voice, collected from children under the age of 13. To comply with COPPA, explicit permission must be sought from parents or guardians for operators collecting, processing, and storing kids voice data. In Europe, the forthcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) legislation of May 2018, is set to equal COPPA in these respects.A mainstream example can be found in an episode of HBO’s comedy series, Silicon Valley. The show highlighted the problem of collecting children’s data without permission when the character Dinesh unknowingly violated the rules, resulting in billions of dollars worth of fines.Home devices such as Google Home and Amazon’s Alexa work pretty much out of the box, allowing you to immediately use voice commands to do simple things like set timers, tell jokes, read the news, and check weather forecasts. So while both provide the option of creating user profiles for kids where parents can give their consent, you are not required to do so prior to using the device.So, what happens if a user has not yet given permission for their child’s data to be collected, but they are still using the device? How about when a user has given permission for their child’s data to be collected but their friend is visiting the house?To address such scenarios, the FTC recently relaxed the rule, just enough that common tasks like voice searches can be done for kids without risk to the company. Specifically, the FTC will not take an enforcement action against an operator for not obtaining parental consent before collecting the audio file from a child’s when it is collected solely as a replacement of written words, such as to perform a search or to fulfill a verbal instruction or request — as long as it is held for a brief time and only for that purpose. So, we’re all good right?Well, yes, but just so we’re clear — the FTC now require operators, without parental consent, to immediately delete children’s voice data. This includes not storing data or extracting information from the data to improve the voice service. It’s worth noting that the EU GDPR has not provided any such leniency or guidance on this matter. So, is this actually being done? Can all operators in this space hold their hands up and confirm that they are immediately deleting voice data for all kids they don’t have consent for? It’s not likely, but we certainly should hope so.Companies must state how they will use the dataLastly, all operators need to clearly articulate how they intend to use legally acquired kids voice data. Will the voice data simply be used to improve the speech recognition services, with data remaining in the company? Or will the child’s voice data be sold to third parties for data mining and marketing purposes?We must acknowledge and expect that children will use these voice assistants and smart devices when they are so easily accessible in the home. Voice interactions have many positive benefits allowing kids to naturally interact with technology without the need for screens. As we watch the rise of the voice interface as it becomes more integrated into our appliances, our cars, our personal devices, and what is needed is for child-specific interfaces with appropriate responses. This means not allowing children open access to web browsing, purchasing, inappropriate language, or content — or allow video calling to your contacts, etc.While full compliance with US COPPA and EU GDPR is required by law, grey areas remain in this fast changing technology space. Companies leading the voice assistant space need to provide more transparency with respect to children’s voice data: Do operators immediately detect kids voices as distinguished from adults and if so, is all kids voice data immediately deleted where permission has not been obtained? If permission was granted, how is the data used and who has access to it?",Voice assistants aren’t built for kids — we need to fix that

Samsung was here in full-force, Sony outed a pair of surprisingly compelling flagship phones, Vivo showed up with yet another kooky concept -- the list goes on. As always, though, Team Engadget happened upon some other developments that captivated us more than we expected. That's MWC for you -- it'll always catch you by surprise.As we board our planes and begin our long treks home, join us for a final look at some of our favorite things -- not just gadgets -- from MWC. (Oh, and take a gander at our unnerving AR emoji while you're at it.)Edgar Alvarez, Senior EditorNot only does it have the potential to help cops or firefighters during emergencies with features like a removable heart rate monitor and body camera -- it looks like it came straight out of a menswear runway show, too. Its fashionable streetwear looks are no accident either, since Nokia worked with Kolon (a South Korean fashion brand) to design the jacket. I'll probably never own it, but at least I got to try it on for a few minutes here in Barcelona.Cherlynn Low, Reviews EditorGalaxy S9/S9+ AR emojisOf all the new features of the Galaxy S9 and S9+, the most interesting is AR Emoji. Sure, it's easy to dismiss this feature as an imitation of Apple's Animoji, and the emoji themselves creep some people out. But the fact that they were controversial and invite participation makes this arguably the standout addition to the Galaxy S series. Technologically, the feature isn't the most impressive -- its depiction of faces varies wildly in accuracy, there are limited styles to choose from when customizing your avatar and the front camera struggles to pick up your facial movements and reproduce them.Still, almost everyone on my team here made their own AR Emoji and some of them even clamored to try it out. We had a ball of a time doing impressions of each other, using the person's avatar. Yes, the novelty of AR Emojis will eventually wear out, but for now it provided a hell of a lot of fun, and certainly cheered me up this cold, bleak MWC.Mat Smith, UK Bureau ChiefThe exaggerated death of the headphone jackAny company that makes wireless headphones and buds might try to convince you that the future is set: get rid of those silly (cheaper, universal) headphones, and get some Bluetooth things instead.However, MWC 2018's graduating class of smartphones had only three devices that nixed the 3.5mm socket: Sony's duo of Xperia XZ2 phones and Nokia's new flagship redesign, the Sirocco 8. Options are good. Holding onto my reliable, wired, no-recharge needed earbuds is even better.Nick Summers, ReporterHuawei MateBook X ProI'm still searching for my dream Windows laptop. I like the Dell XPS 13, but the design is dull and the bezel between the hinge and the display is a little large for my tastes. I like the Surface Laptop too, but it's expensive and the alcantara material worries me. That's why I'm so intrigued by the Huawei MateBook X Pro that was announced at Mobile World Congress.It has a simple, Macbook-esque look and the screen-to-body ratio is phenomenal. The pop-up webcam? It's a nice idea, but I think the up-the-nose viewing angle is awful. Thankfully, I rarely take video calls. Otherwise, the MateBook X Pro seems like a solid ultrabook with plenty of power and an adequate selection of ports. Everything I want, basically, from a Macbook Pro replacement.Chris Velazco, Senior Mobile EditorThe first wave of Android Go Edition phonesAndroid Go was first announced at last year's Google I/O developer conference, but the first Go Edition phones just showed up here in Spain. In terms of hardware, none of them are particularly special, save for maybe the cutesy, familiar Nokia 1. Even so, I find Google's commitment to building a more consistent kind of Android experience for people, no matter how much they paid for their smartphone, terribly admirable.Google's suite of Go-enabled apps are a pleasure to use too, and I'm pleased that vital features like Google Assistant are now available to just about everyone. It'll take some time to really understand Android Go's impact, but since Google has confirmed it will make Go builds for future Android versions, I think we just might be entering the golden age of cheap phones.James Trew, Managing EditorChris is Engadget's senior mobile editor and moonlights as a professional moment ruiner.

10020,3947924,2018-03-03 15:00:00,"For this iPhone clone maker, it's all about survivalA Chinese company called Leagoo made headlines at MWC for showing off its S9, a cheap Android phone that looks like an iPhone X and swiped Samsung's flagship name. These kinds of clones have been a part of the industry forever, clogging up eBay and disappointing whoever buys them. The S9 is indeed the latest in a long line of clones, but as I discovered, the forces that brought it to market are more interesting than the facsimile itself.After all, it seems odd that a company with the resources to build a portfolio of products and lock down a sponsorship deal with Tottenham Hotspur FC would resort to blatant copying. And these copies aren't much to write home about either. The S9s at Leagoo's booth ran a very buggy version of Android, and the hardware felt chintzy and insubstantial. Those software issues should get worked out before launch, but honestly, this is exactly the kind of cut-rate experience you'd expect from a $150 iPhone clone. That said, the bits of the iPhone X Leagoo attempted to copy at least look correct.The notch is roughly the right size, and the 13+2MP dual camera around back looks more or less spot-on, even if it doesn't take particularly great pictures. The Leagoo S9 I played with seemed far from finished, but even at its best, it seems unlikely to thrill.Chris Velazco/EngadgetAnd the iPhone isn't the only flagship Leagoo has attempted to ape, either. Off to the side of Leagoo's booth at MWC was a plasticky phone with a dual camera and stripes etched horizontally high on its back. That was the company aiming at a domestic rival: Huawei's high-powered Mate 10 Pro. In fairness, Leagoo designs and produces original smartphones as well -- quite a few, in fact.After a conversation with Leagoo Senior Vice President Zhijie Xie, things became more clear. For Leagoo, cranking out the occasional clone phone isn't just a way for the company to capitalize on new trends in the industry. It's about survival.""For right now, the situation for the mobile phone business,"" Xie said, his voice trailing off a little. ""Especially [when you're] like us -- you just have to stay alive.""The S9 then is pure marketing given physical form, a device meant to drive buzz in hopes of boosting the business as a whole. If this sounds familiar, well, it should: that's the idea being the new Nokia's string of retro phone releases.""This one just makes some noise,"" conceded Xie while gesturing to the S9.The weariness in his voice was apparent, and he's earned it. Leagoo is still a small company, with only a few hundred employees and two factories: one in Shenzhen and one in Sichuan province. And given the sort of global competition small companies like Leagoo face, carving out a space in the market is no easy feat. On a large scale, Apple and Samsung tend to dominate both smartphone conversations and market share to the point where even highly capable competitors are struggling to make an impact.""Even for LG and Sony sales are going down every year,"" Xie said. ""We just [have to] stay alive and try to find some core-selling products."" Leagoo's search for those core products has been a tricky one so far. Xie pointed out that the company's M-series smartphones were doing well, but a recent release fizzled out because of performance issues related to its Spreadtrum chipset. These kinds of issues seem even more painful when you consider Leagoo's limited reach. Despite its firmly Chinese origins, Leagoo doesn't sell phones there at all. All of the companies efforts are concentrated in southeast Asia and eastern Europe, partially because standing up to China's internal competition can be nearly impossible for upstarts.""We never did China,"" Xie added. ""The competition is too strong. Huawei, Xiaomi, Meizu, they're all there."" And beyond just being there, those companies have much more experience cutting deals with Chinese carriers and retailers, leading to a situation where smaller can be boxed out of their own home.""At the beginning, we created this company and decided to only focus on overseas markets,"" said Xie. ""In China, you sometimes need relationships; we do not have the background, and so we chose fair markets. If you work hard, if your products are good, you can sell.""I'll admit to being surprised after playing with a few other Leagoo smartphones at the booth. They were perfectly passable devices.

10021,3948177,2018-03-03 19:00:50,"For months now, much of the media attention on the crypto space has been directed at ebbs and flows in the price of bitcoin on one side, and whiz-bang ICOs on the other.The price of the most valuable cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (specifically the BTC chain), has backpedaled significantly from highs set in December 2017. The chart below shows pricing data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) over the last 365 days.Those dramatic price swings write headlines. And the media, Crunchbase News included, has not been shy in covering bitcoin’s ups and downs.But the comparatively quiet and glacially paced world of traditional venture capital deserves no short shrift from reporters, market analysts and enthusiasts alike. At the time of writing, 2018’s venture fundraising totals alone are more than 40 percent of the way to 2017’s high water mark, according to Crunchbase data.And it’s been only around two months since the start of the year.But like all emerging technologies, and most nascent companies working on them, there’s no telling whether these bets will generate significant returns. Like with the very cryptocurrency mining computers hashing away at these blockchains, venture investment in this ecosystem may prove to be a waste of energy and a lot of hot air. But venture investors seem alright with buying equity during the dip.Here we’ll see how much venture money is being invested, by whom and where these venture-backed crypto companies call home.(Data) mining for insights into blockchain and blockchain-adjacent companiesTo avoid any complaints from so-called maximalist supporters of any one cryptocurrency or blockchain ecosystem, we’re going to base the following analysis on a fairly wide basket of companies.To learn more about the data set of companies we used for this article, skip to the bottom for notes on methodology. What follows is an analysis of the data that shakes out of our bundle of crypto companies.Despite all the market hype around ICOs, some of which have raised hundreds of millions of dollars, venture investment in blockchain and related companies has kept pace, as well.What’s captured here are just good ol’ fashioned venture rounds — convertible notes, seed and angel rounds, Series As and on through the alphabet — not the Wild West world of ICOs. The chart above excludes rounds labeled as ICOs, even if they had participation from VCs.The chart makes an important point: Despite price volatility in crypto-land’s most valued blockchain asset, bitcoin (specifically the BTC chain) venture investment — in terms of sheer dollar volume — is on pace to eclipse even the banner year of 2017.So we’ve seen how much is being invested, but which countries are leading the way?Listed headquarters of recently funded companies reveals legal trendsIn the chart below, we chart the location of the blockchain companies that raised venture funding in 2017 and 2018 so far.Two main features stand out from the chart above: venture fundraising activity in blockchain and blockchain-adjacent companies is highly concentrated in just a handful of countries, with the U.S. leading the way, and a small but growing percentage of companies are choosing to locate themselves in countries with friendly attitudes toward blockchain and cryptocurrency innovation.The two that stand out here are Singapore and Switzerland, each of which are home to (at least) four percent of the startups that raised venture funding over the last 14 months. Over the course of reporting on other stories, Crunchbase News has learned from investors and entrepreneurs that many Asia-focused blockchain companies and investors in Singapore and Hong Kong are increasingly attractive domiciles for Chinese firms leaving that country in the wake of regulatory crackdown. Japan and Malaysia are also popular locales in Asia for blockchain companies and funds, in part thanks to permissive regulatory environments.In Europe, Switzerland has been particularly progressive when it comes to clarifying policies around cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. At CryptoCon in Chicago earlier this month, Brent Traidman, chief revenue officer for Zurich-based mobile wallet-maker Bread, referred to the country as “crypto valley.” Switzerland’s financial authority issued specific guidance to companies looking to raise capital in ICOs last week.As long as the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies and other blockchain assets remains somewhat cryptic in the U.S., American crypto-entrepreneurs may opt to leave the country for clearer legal frameworks abroad.Notes on methodologyHere’s how we found the data we worked with.We first created a list of companies in Crunchbase’s bitcoin, ethereum, blockchain, cryptocurrency and virtual currency categories. Then we took the list of companies in Crunchbase’s data that have raised capital via an initial coin offering (a funding method better known by its initialism ICO). Finally, we created another list of companies that use those keywords, in addition to “digital currency” and “utility token” in their company descriptions.We then combined and de-duplicated the list to produce a data set of just over 2,900 blockchain and blockchain-adjacent organizations that we’ll use in our analysis. And, at least for the purposes of this article, we’re going to refer to these companies using some variation of that inelegant if quite inclusive phrasing: “blockchain and blockchain-adjacent.”",2018 VC investment into crypto startups set to surpass 2017 tally
10022,3948183,2018-03-03 10:01:05,"Life through Lens: inside Google’s plan to re-skin realityWhy ARCore could be the centre of search going forwardShares“It’s the ultimate try before you buy,” says Amit Singh, vice president of AR and VR at Google.He’s referring to the Porsche Mission E Concept that’s being driven around in front of us. But it’s not really there, it’s part of an application developed using ARCore, Google’s powerful software kit that allows developers to create augmented reality experiences for Android phones.Originally locked to the Google Pixel range, Google has opened up the SDK called ARCore 1.0. It’s now out of preview and comes complete with improvements and learnings Google has amassed since first announcing ARCore in August 2017 and before that with its Project Tango platform.“We have scaled it so that it is across 100 million phones and growing,” says Singh.At MWC 2018, it was included in the Samsung Galaxy S9 reveal and it’s available for other Samsung handsets, as well as some LG phones and the OnePlus 5. You can also expect it to come to Asus, Nokia, Huawei and ZTE phones in the near future.“We want AR to be a core feature on Android, at least for the high end phones and then over time for many more,” explains Singh.Scaling is all very well, but if the apps aren’t there it’s moot. Google knows this and that’s why it is looking to tap into different markets with Lens, in particular China.AR for everyone“We’re partnering with Huawei, Xiaomi and Samsung to bring ARCore to this market,” says Singh. Google in its blog post emphasises this, noting, ""Everyone should get to experience augmented reality.""From the demos TechRadar had, everyone should. If driving a car around wasn’t impressive enough, we ducked and got into the interior, analysed the thermodynamics of the vehicle, then color picked from the shirt Singh was wearing and gave the car a coat of paint in that shade.“The ability to re-skin reality is compelling here,” says Aparna Chennapragada, Product Lead of Lens. “But to even create that space you need to know what the semantic meaning is of what you are looking at, and that is why we started Lens.“Yes, we’re putting digital into the real world but we’re attaching semantic meaning to it. If you want to know something about an object, you tap into the rest of Google. The knowledge graph, maps, the whole shebang.""Lens is a powerful visual intelligence layer.”One of the most impressive showcases of this is the cutting-and-pasting of real-life text. Look around you, wherever you are there is some text. But, for obvious reasons, the text isn’t searchable.Google Lens changes this. We were shown this working on a menu - Lens allowed you to take that text, highlight it and explore certain words. It even worked, to some extent, with handwriting.Deceptively simple, incredibly powerful“All those years of understanding different text on web pages comes in really handy,” says Chennapragada. “On the web, you know something in a bigger font is important, something that starts a paragraph is another thing. We use all of that experience and apply it to being able to browse the real world.”“It sounds deceptively simple but it’s incredibly powerful,” continues Chennapragada. “Say, for something like Coachella - you have a lineup on a poster and you want to see what each of these bands are like. You can use Lens, immediately find them on YouTube, and instantly get a sense of who is playing there.”Other demos we were shown included a Snapchat Lens that allowed you to tour Barcelona’s stadium Camp Nou and an app that allowed you to furnish a room.It’s here where ARCore’s technology shows most promise - it doesn’t just have the ability to ‘add’ furniture to a room, but if there is real furniture around, it also has the ability know what that furniture is and may even know the model and make.Search has expanded from typing into a search box to speaking and it’s now clear that the next medium for Google is the camera.“We think about it in two parts: there’s ‘camera in,'” says Chennapragada. That’s what we think about Google Lens when you point the camera at something, make some sense of it, put some meaning to it - is it a building, a business card etc?Then there’s ‘camera out’ which is all of the AR stuff. So, we can put that sticker over there, place a virtual furniture couch in the real world. That is how we are thinking about both and how they come together.“For us that is the evolution of search and information discovery.”MWC (Mobile World Congress) is the world's largest exhibition for the mobile industry, stuffed full of the newest phones, tablets, wearables and more.

10023,3948185,2018-03-03 13:01:40,"Putting the 'real' into virtual reality: the teams building virtual worlds on HTC ViveFantastic HTC Vive experiences and the people who make themSharesHeading to the HTC Vive booth at MWC 2018 was a headset-wearing eye opener for anyone that’s followed the company and its journey into virtual reality.There were scores of developers showing their wares, each focused on delivering an entirely different VR experience that caters for their audience. Walking through it all was a bit like when James Bond enters Q’s lab.The one thread running through was the use of the HTC Vive and, in particular, its the Vive Tracker, which can turn almost anything into a VR controller.“We launched the tracker at last year’s MWC and had one or two examples of what it can do. But this year we brought many more examples,” says Graham Wheeler, Snr Director of VR at HTC.“We want to explain to people that, if you use your imaginations, what you can do with the Vive is basically limitless.”The key to this limitless imagination is that a tracker can be put on pretty much anything.We saw them strapped to arcade-style guns for a demo of zombie shooter Arizona Sunshine, on table tennis bats for some virtual sports fun and, our favorite, shin pads and football boots for the fantastic Mi Hiepa Sports, who have developed a coaching tool that helps footballers train while in rehabilitation.Ball skills“Mental health is a big thing for footballers that can’t train,” says Adam Dickinson, Development Director at the company. “We can help with that with our non-contact training drills and the HTC Vive.”The demo we tried used the second generation Vive trackers, and it was a fantastic experience. The responsiveness of the trackers was very impressive, with the feeling when you actually hit a ball appearing more real than virtual.The demo we tried was a simple passing exercise to hit the balls that came at us into the corresponding goals. The sensors meant that you could add quite a bit of complexity to your moves, including steadying the ball, stopping it with your feet then kicking it into the net.“Don’t forget to look at your feet when you’re playing,” instructed Dickinson before we even kicked a ball.“The sensors are so detailed, they can even respond to the length of the grass which changes how the ball moves.”Looking at our feet, we checked our studs to make sure all was okay - and the level of detail was stunning.It’s not just us saying that, the Manchester-based studio has the likes of Paul Scholes interested in the technology, and it’s currently installed in Manchester United’s training academy.Height clubSwapping boots for balloons, the Grand Canyon hot air balloon VR experience showed off the HTC Vive Pro with the wireless add-on, one of the first times the technology has been available to try out.""We have a child, adult and parent position, and we identify with the child,"" explains Audrone Miskinyte, a professor who is to start using this experience in her studies.""It's natural, spontaneous, curious, and fun-seeking, and this kind of child can help us overcome our biggest fears – the child can set an example, can encourage, and can distract, and help us overcome our fear.""Our untethered experience came in the form of the HTC Vive Focus - the headset that's currently only available in China at the moment. Regardless of its unavailability in the western market, Wheeler believes it shows off the best of what Vive has to offer.“People know that they will get the highest possible experience on each of the elements, when they use a Vive,” says Wheeler.“The Vive Focus offers six degree of freedom ‘world-scale’ tracking in a mobile setting so is the most premium experience on mobile.”After rolling around dodging shots and cowering behind some crates, we can attest to this.Coming into FocusThe HTC Vive Focus is a powerful device. It uses the same lenses (1,600 x 1,440 OLED display) as the HTC Vive Pro and is powered by a Snapdragon 835 processor. It’s mobile but doesn’t use a phone, which is a key differentiator when looking at it compared to something like the Samsung Gear VR. Launching first in China is a strategic move, explains Wheeler.“The Vive Focus is in a very different market. In China they don’t have Google or Facebook, so that market has different requirements. What we are trying to do is take the lead role in that environment,” he notes.“The Wave SDK, which is the open source SDK that the Focus is built on, isn’t just in HTC but in multiple manufacturers. So they can come and use our Vive Port and have different products and tiers and this allows us to get different developers on board which means we end up having great content.“That’s why we have launched it in China and we want to grow that. We are keeping a close eye on it for other markets but we are not announcing anything yet.”While HTC is keeping a close eye on China and the Vive Focus, everyone else is keeping a close eye on HTC. With mounting losses and persistent rumors of its Vive division being spun off, it is showcases like the one at MWC 2018 that may make the difference between success and failure for the headset.Wheeler is upbeat about what the future holds and he puts it all down to the tech innovations HTC is at the forefront at the moment.“Looking to the future, if you take AR, VR, 5G and AI - we are an expert in all of those fields and have a heritage in smartphones, the VR segment.""Tie all of those together and you have convergence. We see it as the Vive reality, where all of those experiences comes together.“It’s testament to how difficult it is to create the Vive experience [that there aren’t only a few trying to compete in the VR space].“We are setting a benchmark and people are trying to strive to that benchmark and that’s a brilliant scenario for us.”MWC (Mobile World Congress) is the world's largest exhibition for the mobile industry, stuffed full of the newest phones, tablets, wearables and more.

10024,3948257,2018-03-02 14:47:56,"TNW SitesToot toot: 6 top tips to tremendous traffic in 2018I’ve found in my entrepreneurial efforts, and when I’ve consulted and mentored other companies, that a great product or service will only take you so far. Without the right marketing tools in place to back it up, that great idea will likely go overlooked and forgotten, no matter how fresh or exciting an idea it might be.Unsurprisingly, one of the best ways to get great results for your startup is taking steps to improve your web traffic. But how?While quickly growing your web traffic may seem like a challenging task, it’s essential for entrepreneurs who are serious about increasing their sales and leads. So how can you take your website traffic to new heights in the coming year?Here are a few key (and simple) “hacks” that have made a difference for me and will help you get started:1) Fine-tune your siteThe time for New Year’s resolutions may be past, but anytime is an ideal time to evaluate your website and its strengths and weaknesses. After all, the quality of your site doesn’t just impact the user experience once someone arrives at your site — it can also affect where you end up in SEO rankings.Focus on the factors that search engines take into consideration when determining your ranking, particularly site speed, mobile optimization, and long-tail keyword implementation.To ensure that your pages load quickly, be on the lookout for large files (particularly photos and videos) that could be compressed or embedded.Look for any other areas that might impact your site’s usability or keep it from living up to Google’squality guidelines. Among others, tools like Google’s very own PageSpeed Insights make it easy to determine exactly where you need to improve.2) Become a guest bloggerNo — it’s no longer 2005 — but if you really wish to spread the word about your company, guest blogging is still one of the best ways to get started. This is one way I continue to spread the word for my own businesses.Even the most authoritative of third-party publishing sites typically allow you to link to your company’s website in your author bio — this presents a great opportunity to generate quality backlinks and inform new potential customers about your business.Of course, you shouldn’t try to write for just any website. Look for high-ranking sites that target your particular niche, as these are more likely to reach a wide readership.In general, you should avoid sites that seem spammy or have an overabundance of ads. Instead, look for sites with high levels of social interaction and a strong domain authority, as these will generate quality traffic. Use the “veteran test”: If an industry veteran has heard of a publication you already know you have a built-in audience.3) Let advertising automation tools do the ‘heavy lifting’If you can make room in your budget, turning over some of your more web-traffic related work to a third-party service (or freelancer) will deliver far greater results than you could achieve on your own.There are many cool tools and resources available in today’s market to help your company master the main channels that drive web traffic — you just need to know where to look.For example, one tool that I’ve found to be highly effective is StoreYa’sTraffic Booster, which creates PPC campaigns on Google and Facebook and automatically optimizes bids and keywords to drive quality customers to the relevant pages that will convince them to buy.Additionally, high-end resources likeSE Ranking help facilitate the SEO side of things by automating keyword research, backlink monitoring and other factors that have a direct influence on your search ranking.4) Update your listingsWhile your goal should be for your website to appear first when a potential customer searches for your brand, there’s no denying that third-party listings can also play a huge role in whether someone discovers your business in the first place.There are a lot of online directories out there, and you should be sure that individuals who find these listings are provided with accurate URLs and company info.Take the time to go through your listings on sites like Google, Yelp, Yahoo, FourSquare, Yellow Pages, and Bing. If you haven’t already “claimed” a listing for your business, now is the time to do so.This way, you can ensure that customers will receive accurate information (and website links), no matter how they come across your business. Better yet, it also allows you to monitor and respond to reviews.5) Step up your email marketingTargeting new customers is great, but your pre-existing client base is generally more likely to come back to your website and make additional purchases. They sometimes just need an extra reminder — and the best way to do that is through email marketing.Use email addresses you’ve collected from landing pages, social media, and paying customers to form tightly targeted lists. Focus the content of your emails based on where a particular user might be in your conversion funnel, providing them with useful information, engaging headlines, and of course, links to where they can learn more on your site.A properly targeted email can ultimately lead to more sales — emails reminding users of an abandoned shopping cart have animpressive 40.5 percent open rate, helping businesses recapture lost web traffic and sales.6) Provide free contentRegularly posting new blog content to your website can be a great way to attract site visitors — in fact, consistent blogging cantriple your inbound traffic. But blogging alone is just a first step.To really drive traffic to your website, you often need to provide some sort of additional incentive.Providing a free ebook or access to a special seminar will require more writing than a typical blog post. You’ll not only need to write the content; you’ll also need to make it visually appealing and spread the word via Facebook and other channels so people can discover it.However, when done right, these engaging forms of free content will help you build up your email lists, generate leads and create opportunities for new and recurring traffic.A fresh startEven if you haven’t achieved the web traffic results you were hoping for in the past, there’s no reason why 2018 can’t become a rousing success.As you use the above tips and tools to bring more potential customers to your website, you’ll soon be able to achieve the growth and profitability you’ve been working so hard to achieve.",Toot toot: 6 top tips to tremendous traffic in 2018

10026,3950646,2018-02-20 16:05:38,"The Tyranny of ConvenienceConvenience is the most underestimated and least understood force in the world today. As a driver of human decisions, it may not offer the illicit thrill of Freud’s unconscious sexual desires or the mathematical elegance of the economist’s incentives. Convenience is boring. But boring is not the same thing as trivial.In the developed nations of the 21st century, convenience — that is, more efficient and easier ways of doing personal tasks — has emerged as perhaps the most powerful force shaping our individual lives and our economies. This is particularly true in America, where, despite all the paeans to freedom and individuality, one sometimes wonders whether convenience is in fact the supreme value.As Evan Williams, a co-founder of Twitter, recently put it, “Convenience decides everything.” Convenience seems to make our decisions for us, trumping what we like to imagine are our true preferences. (I prefer to brew my coffee, but Starbucks instant is so convenient I hardly ever do what I “prefer.”) Easy is better, easiest is best.Convenience has the ability to make other options unthinkable. Once you have used a washing machine, laundering clothes by hand seems irrational, even if it might be cheaper. After you have experienced streaming television, waiting to see a show at a prescribed hour seems silly, even a little undignified. To resist convenience — not to own a cellphone, not to use Google — has come to require a special kind of dedication that is often taken for eccentricity, if not fanaticism.For all its influence as a shaper of individual decisions, the greater power of convenience may arise from decisions made in aggregate, where it is doing so much to structure the modern economy. Particularly in tech-related industries, the battle for convenience is the battle for industry dominance.Americans say they prize competition, a proliferation of choices, the little guy. Yet our taste for convenience begets more convenience, through a combination of the economics of scale and the power of habit. The easier it is to use Amazon, the more powerful Amazon becomes — and thus the easier it becomes to use Amazon. Convenience and monopoly seem to be natural bedfellows.Given the growth of convenience — as an ideal, as a value, as a way of life — it is worth asking what our fixation with it is doing to us and to our country. I don’t want to suggest that convenience is a force for evil. Making things easier isn’t wicked. On the contrary, it often opens up possibilities that once seemed too onerous to contemplate, and it typically makes life less arduous, especially for those most vulnerable to life’s drudgeries.But we err in presuming convenience is always good, for it has a complex relationship with other ideals that we hold dear. Though understood and promoted as an instrument of liberation, convenience has a dark side. With its promise of smooth, effortless efficiency, it threatens to erase the sort of struggles and challenges that help give meaning to life. Created to free us, it can become a constraint on what we are willing to do, and thus in a subtle way it can enslave us.It would be perverse to embrace inconvenience as a general rule. But when we let convenience decide everything, we surrender too much.Convenience as we now know it is a product of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when labor-saving devices for the home were invented and marketed. Milestones include the invention of the first “convenience foods,” such as canned pork and beans and Quaker Quick Oats; the first electric clothes-washing machines; cleaning products like Old Dutch scouring powder; and other marvels including the electric vacuum cleaner, instant cake mix and the microwave oven.Convenience was the household version of another late-19th-century idea, industrial efficiency, and its accompanying “scientific management.” It represented the adaptation of the ethos of the factory to domestic life.However mundane it seems now, convenience, the great liberator of humankind from labor, was a utopian ideal. By saving time and eliminating drudgery, it would create the possibility of leisure. And with leisure would come the possibility of devoting time to learning, hobbies or whatever else might really matter to us. Convenience would make available to the general population the kind of freedom for self-cultivation once available only to the aristocracy. In this way convenience would also be the great leveler.This idea — convenience as liberation — could be intoxicating. Its headiest depictions are in the science fiction and futurist imaginings of the mid-20th century. From serious magazines like Popular Mechanics and from goofy entertainments like “The Jetsons” we learned that life in the future would be perfectly convenient. Food would be prepared with the push of a button. Moving sidewalks would do away with the annoyance of walking. Clothes would clean themselves or perhaps self-destruct after a day’s wearing. The end of the struggle for existence could at last be contemplated.The dream of convenience is premised on the nightmare of physical work. But is physical work always a nightmare? Do we really want to be emancipated from all of it? Perhaps our humanity is sometimes expressed in inconvenient actions and time-consuming pursuits. Perhaps this is why, with every advance of convenience, there have always been those who resist it. They resist out of stubbornness, yes (and because they have the luxury to do so), but also because they see a threat to their sense of who they are, to their feeling of control over things that matter to them.By the late 1960s, the first convenience revolution had begun to sputter. The prospect of total convenience no longer seemed like society’s greatest aspiration. Convenience meant conformity. The counterculture was about people’s need to express themselves, to fulfill their individual potential, to live in harmony with nature rather than constantly seeking to overcome its nuisances. Playing the guitar was not convenient. Neither was growing one’s own vegetables or fixing one’s own motorcycle. But such things were seen to have value nevertheless — or rather, as a result. People were looking for individuality again.Perhaps it was inevitable, then, that the second wave of convenience technologies — the period we are living in — would co-opt this ideal. It would conveniencize individuality.You might date the beginning of this period to the advent of the Sony Walkman in 1979. With the Walkman we can see a subtle but fundamental shift in the ideology of convenience. If the first convenience revolution promised to make life and work easier for you, the second promised to make it easier to be you. The new technologies were catalysts of selfhood. They conferred efficiency on self-expression.Consider the man of the early 1980s, strolling down the street with his Walkman and earphones. He is enclosed in an acoustic environment of his choosing. He is enjoying, out in public, the kind of self-expression he once could experience only in his private den. A new technology is making it easier for him to show who he is, if only to himself. He struts around the world, the star of his own movie.So alluring is this vision that it has come to dominate our existence. Most of the powerful and important technologies created over the past few decades deliver convenience in the service of personalization and individuality. Think of the VCR, the playlist, the Facebook page, the Instagram account. This kind of convenience is no longer about saving physical labor — many of us don’t do much of that anyway. It is about minimizing the mental resources, the mental exertion, required to choose among the options that express ourselves. Convenience is one-click, one-stop shopping, the seamless experience of “plug and play.” The ideal is personal preference with no effort.We are willing to pay a premium for convenience, of course — more than we often realize we are willing to pay. During the late 1990s, for example, technologies of music distribution like Napster made it possible to get music online at no cost, and lots of people availed themselves of the option. But though it remains easy to get music free, no one really does it anymore. Why? Because the introduction of the iTunes store in 2003 made buying music even more convenient than illegally downloading it. Convenient beat out free.As task after task becomes easier, the growing expectation of convenience exerts a pressure on everything else to be easy or get left behind. We are spoiled by immediacy and become annoyed by tasks that remain at the old level of effort and time. When you can skip the line and buy concert tickets on your phone, waiting in line to vote in an election is irritating. This is especially true for those who have never had to wait in lines (which may help explain the low rate at which young people vote).The paradoxical truth I’m driving at is that today’s technologies of individualization are technologies of mass individualization. Customization can be surprisingly homogenizing. Everyone, or nearly everyone, is on Facebook: It is the most convenient way to keep track of your friends and family, who in theory should represent what is unique about you and your life. Yet Facebook seems to make us all the same. Its format and conventions strip us of all but the most superficial expressions of individuality, such as which particular photo of a beach or mountain range we select as our background image.I do not want to deny that making things easier can serve us in important ways, giving us many choices (of restaurants, taxi services, open-source encyclopedias) where we used to have only a few or none. But being a person is only partly about having and exercising choices. It is also about how we face up to situations that are thrust upon us, about overcoming worthy challenges and finishing difficult tasks — the struggles that help make us who we are. What happens to human experience when so many obstacles and impediments and requirements and preparations have been removed?Today’s cult of convenience fails to acknowledge that difficulty is a constitutive feature of human experience. Convenience is all destination and no journey. But climbing a mountain is different from taking the tram to the top, even if you end up at the same place. We are becoming people who care mainly or only about outcomes. We are at risk of making most of our life experiences a series of trolley rides.Convenience has to serve something greater than itself, lest it lead only to more convenience. In her 1963 classic, “The Feminine Mystique,” Betty Friedan looked at what household technologies had done for women and concluded that they had just created more demands. “Even with all the new labor-saving appliances,” she wrote, “the modern American housewife probably spends more time on housework than her grandmother.” When things become easier, we can seek to fill our time with more “easy” tasks. At some point, life’s defining struggle becomes the tyranny of tiny chores and petty decisions.An unwelcome consequence of living in a world where everything is “easy” is that the only skill that matters is the ability to multitask. At the extreme, we don’t actually do anything; we only arrange what will be done, which is a flimsy basis for a life.We need to consciously embrace the inconvenient — not always, but more of the time. Nowadays individuality has come to reside in making at least some inconvenient choices. You need not churn your own butter or hunt your own meat, but if you want to be someone, you cannot allow convenience to be the value that transcends all others. Struggle is not always a problem. Sometimes struggle is a solution. It can be the solution to the question of who you are.Embracing inconvenience may sound odd, but we already do it without thinking of it as such. As if to mask the issue, we give other names to our inconvenient choices: We call them hobbies, avocations, callings, passions. These are the noninstrumental activities that help to define us. They reward us with character because they involve an encounter with meaningful resistance — with nature’s laws, with the limits of our own bodies — as in carving wood, melding raw ingredients, fixing a broken appliance, writing code, timing waves or facing the point when the runner’s legs and lungs begin to rebel against him.Such activities take time, but they also give us time back. They expose us to the risk of frustration and failure, but they also can teach us something about the world and our place in it.So let’s reflect on the tyranny of convenience, try more often to resist its stupefying power, and see what happens. We must never forget the joy of doing something slow and something difficult, the satisfaction of not doing what is easiest. The constellation of inconvenient choices may be all that stands between us and a life of total, efficient conformity.Tim Wu is a law professor at Columbia, the author of “The Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads” and a contributing opinion writer.",Opinion | The Tyranny of Convenience
10027,3950889,2018-03-02 16:21:55,"TNW SitesHow to restore brand credibility after having fucked up publiclySocial media is a place for brands to amplify their stories, humanize themselves, and connect with the people that make them what they are. More recently, it’s also become a stage for consumers to take brands to task for their missteps. As a social strategist and creative on the agency side for the better part of a decade, I’ve seen my share of digital crises and the aftermath.Social has ignited the rise of a culture where bad actors are called out and negative experiences are no longer discussed behind closed doors. Given the nature of social as such an accessible, public channel for consumers to demand accountability and resolution, a single call-out can snowball into a reputation crisis for a brand that isn’t prepared.If anything is crystal clear to me, it’s that call-outs don’t happen in a vacuum. The impact of call-out culture echoes to every aspect of a business, from consumer sentiment to revenue. A single negative post has the potential to reach thousands of people in a matter of seconds, on a truly global scale. If your brand isn’t prepared to react quickly in the face of today’s viral culture, you’re effectively risking your reputation and opening up your bottom line to long-term damage.It starts with accountabilityIn the midst of a brand crisis it’s easy to see the merit in defending your position. But 55 percent of consumers aren’t looking for loaded explanations or defensiveness, they’re looking for an apology and a solution. Reactively explaining, rather than actively fixing, keeps your brand in the hot seat and can lead to lasting negative impressions of your business. A slew of brands are making concerted efforts to move toward humanizing their corporate and social entities, so it makes sense that pushing policy-focused responses and stock language rather than addressing and solving a public problem can rub consumers the wrong way. In most cases, a company needs to respond immediately, be transparent and take action.When Pepsi experienced the PR crisis heard ‘round the world — treading into political waters with a commercial that attempted to speak to its millennial audience — the social reaction was swift. After an immediatebarrage of tweets calling the company out for a seemingly tone-deaf message, the ad was pulled within 24 hours of being released.Pepsi was careful to respond not with defensiveness, but with a plain apology. “Clearly we missed the mark, and we apologize,” Pepsi wrote the following day. A simple media statement that was honest, remorseful, and human.In my experience, the answer to moving forward from a brand nightmare starts with business operations rather than PR damage control. Instead of leaning on a communications team to spin the issue, work toward correcting the issue from within — and immediately follow with an honest, authentic public statement about the importance and execution of those efforts. When the media calamity subsides, the public will remember your response and your effort (or lack thereof) to rectify.Good social care is good businessWe all saw what happened to United last year. It wasn’t pretty and the numbers reflected that. It was estimated that United Airlines’ stock dropped by 6.3 percent within a day following video footage of a passenger being forcibly removed from a flight going viral across social media. That’s a $1.4 billion loss in the company’s value. That’s chilling, but devastating results like this can be mitigated when brands leverage social to put a proactive customer care strategy into effect.Data from Twitter shows that customer care on their platform is the key ingredient to boosting consumers’ willingness to spend. The data shows how a simple response when a customer reaches out to your business increases that consumer’s odds of spending three to 20 percent more with you in the future.Responding not only boosts overall satisfaction, but a consumer’s willingness to spread the word. Customers are 44 percent more likely to share their positive experiences and 30 percent more likely to recommend your brand after receiving a response on social.Rebuilding reputationSocial has never been a more influential tool in consumer decision-making. McKinsey surveyed 20,000 consumers across Europe and found that social recommendations are behind more than a quarter of all purchases. Momentum on social has a ripple effect. Most consumers say they’ll share others’ complaints or join in with their own experiences, setting the stage for the shift in consumers’ buying decisions.So use a crisis as an opportunity to reevaluate everything, from product and advertising to brand strategy. In the wake of Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 recall, the company launched a series of apologetic ads discussing the safety and quality testing of their latest product release, as well as releasing investigation details into the faulty devices. This proactive commitment to transparency seems to have paid off, as the company was able to set record profits that quarter, despite the recall.An interesting learning opportunityMissteps happen in business. A social call-out can be the canary in a coal mine that illuminates a larger issue within your organization. For United, we saw it spur a revision of corporate policy and employee training around the rebooking process; for Samsung, we saw a renewed commitment to enhanced quality testing and the public accountability around that process.A PR blowout on social isn’t the end of your reputation. A leader is always willing to seek out areas to improve and digital crises like these offer us exactly that opportunity. Leverage what you learn about your customers’ experiences through the lens of the call-out, acknowledge and right the issue, and leave the public with a better impression of your brand.",How to restore brand credibility after having fucked up publicly
10028,3950890,2018-03-02 15:42:02,"TNW SitesCryptocurrencies can boost India’s digital ambitions — here’s howThe humble beginning of cryptocurrencies in India was back in 2013, when a vintage pizzeria in Mumbai started accepting Bitcoin. Since then, Indians’ interest in crypto has only increased, leading to the emergence of many Indian crypto exchanges and a number of businesses that accept cryptocurrencies. Considering there are more than 600 million young Indians, it’s palpable that adoption of technology and global trends (including crypto investment) happens at a fairly healthy rate.However, the Indian economy runs on top of complex financial regulations which has far-reaching impact on the crypto investor sentiment in the country. In the midst of complex regulations and inherently volatile market, the crypto scene thrives and comes with additional India-specific issues.In this piece I’ll show you the nuances of the Indian market and why virtual currencies can actually accelerate the growth of digital India by working seamlessly with something known as ‘India Stack.’Cloudy with a chance of legitimacyAccording to a recent IT survey, the Indian crypto market is adding 200,000 tech-savvy traders every month and in the last 17 months, $3.5 billion worth of transactions have been conducted. Looking at the massive growth, it’s imperative that the stakeholders are eagerly waiting for a clear stance from the government.While different countries have taken both positive and negative decisions on cryptocurrencies, in India the apex financial regulator, i.e., the Reserve Bank of India has been issuing warnings to investors since December 2013 — the year the Mumbai pizzeria started accepting Bitcoin.The underlying theme has remained the same until today, there can be severe security and financial risk associated with cryptocurrency investment and trading. Therefor the government might not be able to protect the consumers who are exposed to this volatile market.The finance minister, Mr. Arun Jaitley has confirmed that the virtual currencies are not legal tender in India — this means that right now cryptocurrencies cannot be used as an alternative to INR. Hence, although there’s no ban on trading, the crypto market remains unregulated without any legal framework.But recently there was new development in cryptocurrency legislation in India, the Union Budget of 2018 presented on February 1has the following key takeaways :The government will proactively take steps to curb illegal activities that are driven by cryptocurrenciesThe government will also explore use of distributed ledger technology as part of Digital India initiativeThis is in line with the recent news that India is planning to regulate trading of digital currencies — an important step to stop unlawful acts. It’s quite crucial since India is already fighting issues like cross-border terrorism and the government is wary of the possibility that black money is being channeled into the crypto market which further fuels such type of danger. Therefore, the new law will have two-pronged agenda, i.e., establish guidelines so that the source of money can be tracked and common investors can be protected.It’d be worthy to note that in India all the crypto exchanges are already KYC compliant and capital transfer happens via digital banking. This is in quite contrast to South Korea which recently implemented the regulations to use the same name in both the bank and the exchange.Virtual currency are great for India StackIndia Stack is an ambitious project for 1.3 billion Indians which has been described as the following according to the official website:“IndiaStack is a set of APIs that allows governments, businesses, startups, and developers to utilize an unique digital infrastructure to solve India’s hard problems towards presence-less, paperless, and cashless service delivery.”They key for us is the “cashless service delivery” part and the unique ID system on top which India Stack operates, i.e., Aadhaar — the world’s largest biometric ID system which has enrolled more than 1.2 billion Indians. Since its inception, it’s become absolutely seamless for any Indian to open a digital bank account and link the existing account to the ID as well.Although this is the platform on which the digital banking system and payment network is getting built, in order to become truly cashless what we’ll need is a blockchain-powered cryptocurrency that has approval of the Government.This will bring about a drastic change in the way financial transactions are conducted and lead to complete eradication of corruption — including money laundering and tax evasion. Apart from that, the large consumer base which is moving towards digital economy will get the benefit of improved online transactions. This would also remove the surcharges levied on card payments resulting in benefits for both small and medium businesses and consumers.Perhaps this is not far from us — back in November 2017, there were news around introduction of Laxmi (Goddess of wealth) coin which would be legally approved by the Indian government. The official website of the coin doesn’t give any date of launch, other than the statement that it will be available soon. Nothing has been confirmed by the government as well.Moreover, we already have examples of countries adopting crypto coins — Arizona senate has passed bill to accept income tax payment via cryptocoins and Russia is about to issue CryptoRuble. Apart from that, Venezuela has already launched state-sponsored coin called Petro to allow people to pay for taxes and public services. Although it’s argued that the petrol-backed coin has emerged as a means to counter the looming economic crisis, its utility in a government setup is a great example.The futureThe very nature (peer-to-peer) of these coins make them somewhat insulated from the purview of the government. So instead of remaining silent, the government needs to clearly define the asset class of cryptocurrency — a commodity, an asset, or a security apart from devising regulatory framework around trading and investment. This will help the government gain additional capital from tax and embrace something that has potential to boost the GDP as well.Considering that the blockchain-based technologies are rapidly growing and they are well poised to disrupt several traditional industries, the government needs to craft a conducive environment that can foster economic decentralization, social parity, and better access to global financial market.",Cryptocurrencies can boost India’s digital ambitions — here’s how
10029,3954013,2018-03-04 01:05:20,"Tina Sharkey has something to sell you (300 things, actually)0Brandless is an usual company. A direct-to-consumer purveyor of food, beauty, and personal care products, it says that every item it makes is non-genetically modified, kosher, fair-trade, gluten-free, often organic and, in the case of cleaning supplies, EPA “Safer Choice” certified. They are also priced at $3 across the board. The idea, says cofounder and CEO Tina Sharkey, is to “democratize better.” She believes that Brandless — which is very much a brand — is selling items to people, often with dietary restrictions, who “couldn’t shop their values” before Brandless.That’s no small thing to Sharkey, who cares very much about Brandless’s customers, as anyone who has seen her speak publicly can attest. In fact, Sharkey, appearing at a StrictlyVC event earlier this week, spoke about the importance of shared principles in sweeping language that elicited fervor in many of the gathered listeners — and some fatigue in others.She talked of Brandless users who “didn’t have access before” to affordable gluten-free and organic products or “who had to drive 100 miles round trip” or who “didn’t know things existed like tree-free toilet paper, made with sugar cane and bamboo grasses.” (This last product was news to us, too.)Sharkey — who has led a number of consumer-facing companies in her career, including cofounding iVillage and later serving as president and CEO of BabyCenter — said she sees in Brandless users “all of America,” not just those who “live in such a frickin’ bubble on the coasts.”Elites in East and West Coast cities are “not our country” alone, she continued. “Our country is filled with extraordinary people, and we have bifurcated and sliced and diced and segmented people to such a degree that we’ve forgotten that we’re all awesome Americans, and American deserve better, no matter your politics.”If it was hard to remember at times that she was talking about a company that sells nearly 300 household items, from maple syrup to fluoride-free toothpaste, the crowd didn’t seem to notice, nodding along in agreement.Sharkey doesn’t reveal much publicly about revenue or user or growth numbers, though in fairness, it’s early days. She prefers talking instead about the roughly 70 percent savings that Brandless says it provides customers compared with more established brands of similar quality, whose goods are usually purchased on retail shelves. Brandless calls this mark-up a “brand tax” and has trademarked the term.Sharkey is also quick to note what else Brandless does for its customers. For example, in addition to selling affordable products that it says are better for users, Brandless has partnered with the charitable organization Feeding America, a nationwide network of 200 food banks that’s trying to fight hunger in the United States. When customers check out, they are informed that they’ve just purchased a meal for someone, which, according to a footnote on Brandless’s website, is the equivalent of just 9 cents per order.Sharkey is finding other ways to shape Brandless’s positive narrative, too, including Brandless Life, a content-rich initiative that’s currently in beta and designed to both keep shoppers engaged and sell them more products.As Sharkey explained it, the company already has at its fingertips a lot of data to put to further use, including about what attracts visitors, how often they return to shop, and what drives them to either try new things or replenish items they’ve purchased in the past. Why not use it to boost sales?By way of illustration, snacks falls into the “expandable consumption” category, Sharkey said, adding, “If I send you a huge box of snacks, you’re likely to eat them or share them at the office or soccer game.” On the other hand, she’d said, “If I send you a huge box of our peppermint mouthwash” — which Sharkey observed is “alcohol- and sulfate-free and just $3” — a shopper “is not likely to gargle more.”Largely, it’s such “one-and-done” products that Brandless believes it can sell more of, including by proposing new uses for them via breezy articles and videos. As it pertains to that mouthwash, said Sharkey, “Did you know you can clean your washing machine with it? Did you know you could soak paper towels with it and put it at the bottom of your garbage?” Users will soon, she suggested.Of course, whether Brandless succeeds or fails will ultimately depend on the quality of its products and how many people it persuades to try them. For all of Sharkey’s talk about community and content and Brandless’s mindfulness about those in need, the company’s Brandless products better taste and perform better than everyone else’s on the market in a similar price band.Roughly $50 million in funding from investors, which Brandless quietly closed before hitting the market last summer, should help get them there.But Sharkey is a powerful force, too. Though we would have preferred learning more about the company’s inner workings — and its challenges — Sharkey’s marketing approach, her avowed belief that sales come from “understanding people, first and foremost” and her emphasis on “connecting people around their affinities and passions,” may well be a strategy that pays.More than an hour after wrapping up her talk, numerous attendees could still be overheard singing Sharkey’s praises. “Ugh, I just loved Tina’s talk,” one of them told us on her way out the door. “I hadn’t even heard of Brandless until tonight. I’m definitely buying something from that woman.”","Tina Sharkey has something to sell you (300 things, actually)"
10030,3954015,2018-03-03 18:00:02,"Most of us tend to think people trying to open the door when we’re away want to steal stuff. Amazon.com would like to change that assumption.The e-commerce giant shelled out a reported $1.1 billion this week to acquire Ring, a developer of Wi-Fi-connected door bells. The move follows the rollout last year of Amazon Key, a smart lock and camera system for in-home deliveries to customers who don’t want packages sitting outside.But Amazon’s not the only one placing high value on front-door tech. In the age of on-demand delivery, service providers have long seen the typical low-tech door as an impediment to expansion. Smart-lock developers and home security companies also have been putting resources into the space, alongside a number of venture investors.As we reported a few months ago in an overview of smart-lock and building access investments, the way people open the front door hasn’t changed much in a century. Most of us still get in by turning a flat metal key into a lock. Visitors ring old-fashioned door bells. And there’s commonly no digital record of who came or why.There’s a lot of money going into changing that status quo. Since last year, venture investors have poured more than $200 million into an assortment of companies with businesses and technologies tied to keys, locks and building access. To date, those companies have more than $500 million, according to an analysis of Crunchbase funding data.Ring, which raised $200 million in venture funding, is one of two heavily funded companies to be acquired in recent months. In October, August Home, a smart-lock developer that had raised more than $70 million in venture funding, sold to ASSA ABLOY Group, the largest global supplier of door opening products, for an undisclosed sum.There’s good reason to think the up cycle for smart locks and entry systems has further to go. For one, to a large degree, lock and building access-related investments are an extension of the connected home space, and growing adoption of connected home systems provides a major entry point for key and door tech.Many legitimate businesses also want an easier way to get through the door. After all, delivering things to customers’ doors, either inside or out, constitutes an industry with a collective valuation in the trillions of dollars. Amazon.com alone is valued at more than $700 billion.Additionally, anecdotally, it does appear urban humans over recent decades are trending toward greater laziness. Increasingly, people want their laundry, meal kits, produce, shaving supplies and pet treats delivered to their doors. Just as we used to think of going to the store as a pain, we will soon consider stepping outside to pick up a package as the height of inconvenience.Those trends might not be great for the state of humanity. But they are bullish indicators for the smart lock industry.","Front-door tech is hot, and it’s not just Amazon who wants in"

10032,3956497,2018-03-03 23:37:36,"How Not To Be A CrankIf you ever wanted to see me dressed as someone whose name is probably Jimmy Stab-Pants or Joey “Crime-Nose” Faffalone, now’s your chance.The above hideous depiction is from an article in Science Magazine, introducing my work with Nick. We investigate errors in science, usually social science. Not a lot of people do this work, and we’re quite good at it.We have different styles, but it works. Nick is horrified of making mistakes, because he is English and decent. I am horrified of making mistakes because I am a massive egotist from a faraway planet, high on drugs that have not been invented yet.Anyway.The following is how we avoid being flung, headless and twitching, into the wicker crank basket with the rest of the online monstrosities.Nick, Introductory Note:I’m glad that James asked me to help write this piece.Ever since I got started in the debunking business, my concern has been how not to be lumped in with the ‘wall of gammon’, a.k.a. all the other shouty 50-something white men on the Internet complaining about facts.I haven’t always done as well as I could have at avoiding snarky public comments and over-hasty judgement, but hopefully I’m getting better. My very strong fear of making mistakes (and my inability to feel anything other than extremely bad when I do, even if it doesn’t impact other people very much) probably helps with this.P.S. My head actually does look like that.IntroductionIf you want to be a scientific critic, the primary problem you must overcome is that criticism is hard. When you criticize science in public, you are taking a complicated argument (what you’ve discovered), to people who don’t care very much (the journal where the offending article was published), about the work of someone who wishes you’d shut up (the authors).This can be difficult to navigate. Although it’s often ‘a complete pain in the taint’ more than just ‘difficult’.As much as we like to tell ourselves that science is self-correcting, this phrase really means science contains mechanisms that allow correction, rather than scientific problems will eventually fix themselves via some kind of intellectual osmosis.However, we think we’ve done reasonably well at managing this process so far.The most telling paragraph in Science’s description of our work was:Despite the charged nature of their work — after all, careers can be on the line — Brown and Heathers have attracted surprisingly little criticism from their peers in science. In part, that’s likely because of their strategy of gently but methodically ratcheting up the pressure on authors and journals.We have made arguments that people have listened to. More than occasionally, these arguments have resulted in a correction of the scientific record, and that’s something that allows people to take future criticisms more seriously. It’s generative — be useful and serious, and people will give you license to continue to be so.In other words, people do not think that we are cranks.More importantly, the people who need to be convinced before the formal scientific record can be corrected do not think we are cranks.You can imagine that might help a smidge.“Crank” is a pejorative term used for a person who holds an unshakable belief that most of his or her contemporaries consider to be false.[1] A crank belief is so wildly at variance with those commonly held as to be considered ludicrous. Cranks characteristically dismiss all evidence or arguments which contradict their own unconventional beliefs, making any rational debate a futile task and rendering them impervious to facts, evidence, and rational inferenceThat is, we are not fault-finding where no faults exist, we are not misrepresenting things, we are not dismissing evidence, we are not rude (or, at least, not so rude that the police have been involved), and we are certainly convince-able. We convince each other all the time.A: “Hey, XYZ has a bunch of problems”*five minutes pass*B: “You have missed something very obvious, and I don’t know how your wife puts up with you.”We’ve both been both A and B.Here’s something interesting though: we’ve seen quite a lot of scientific criticism from other people by now, from a variety of angles. And quite often it doesn’t really have the same … cut-through.Specifically, plenty of criticism exists that one or both of us think is potentially or probably valid, and it ends up being totally ignored. The reason for that is generally the delivery — it is where crankery meets dickery.So, while this article is called How Not To Be A Crank, it might be better titled How Not To Be Seen As A Crank, or simply How Not To Be A Dick.Basically, if you’re right and everyone hates you, you’re ineffective.Oh, you can hear the retorts now:“BUT I’M RIGHT! “Yeah, and no-one cares. Do you want to be right at home by yourself, or would you prefer your opinions result in outcomes outside of your apartment?“BUT I AM A HARSH AND UNCOMPROMISING CRITIC”No-one wants to tell you how to feel, or how to be, this is simply a series of points that might help other people care. Maybe even as much as you do.So.Let’s say you think you’ve found a serious problem with a scientific paper or argument, and you’d like to tell people. Here’s how to not be a crank about it:1. Calm. Down.No-one else thinks your problems are as important as you do. Bellowing them, as much as it might be tempting, will shut down everything.It’s amazing this needs to be said, but everything you do will be seen through an emotional prism if you bring a skinful of raw emotion to the table. If you’re highly emotional, people will just assume you’re irrational.Now we’ve got that out of the way…2. Don’t be a dick.Scientific criticism does not exist in a social vacuum. Rather, people exist at every layer of the critical process. Criticism of ideas they publish, represent, or promote will hurt their feelings and their bottom line. Period.This is why you should try not to make it worse by criticizing the people involved too much. It is very hard to avoid calling someone dishonest if they display a continual pattern of totally demonstrable dishonesty, because they probably are. It’s just usually not helpful.So, think what you think, but don’t do it in public. Keep the trash talk for Skype, Twitter, or Facebook DM group where you hang out with your fellow destructo-critics. Let off the steam when you have to. You may deal with venal, terrible, dissembling people who drop dirty underpants in the soup of human progress, but put on your best Pan Am smile, and write the story up for the public with as much professionalism as you can muster.What is infinitely worse than the above, though, is when remarks are personal and gratuitous. Dickery is unnecessary — whisper campaigns, rumour mongering, ‘anonymous notes’ and blackballing aren’t illegal but they are still dickish.And death threats (and trolling, and weird online gender-flavoured violence) are not just deeply unpleasant, they’re CRIMES. If you do this, you are breaking the law AND being a shit human being, and you should either stop or walk yourself into the sun.On a selfish level for us, at least, this sort of behaviour is also counter-productive. Your behaviour is an immediate invitation for the targets of criticism to paint us all with the same brush. Of course this painting is wretchedly dishonest, but you’re practically INVITING them to throw every objection they receive overboard because a small proportion of them contain dickishness. Basically, you’re defanging real criticism because you’re behaving like a child.Frankly, those of us working in error detection / meta-science topics would like to round up anyone giving ammunition to the “all critics are mad dogs” argument, and have them pushed into a giant fan.Now, after these two, a lot of the heavy lifting is done. The rest is just candy, but important candy nonetheless.3. Pick one font. Make it black.What is it with frothing anger and three fonts with red highlighting? Did you transcribe this from your initial notes in crayon? Pick a normal format for communication, one which doesn’t look like you spend the rest of your time fingerpainting, and stick to it.4. Write complete sentences. Not too long.What it is with crankery and the inability to write anything but run-on sentences? If you look like you can’t write, you won’t be read. If you know how to write academic language, why would you abandon that now — at the precise time that you need someone to take you seriously?5. Make friends“I am a warrior from the frozen north, and I bow to no master!”Great. How very masculines of you. When you’re quite finished, admit your weaknesses and make some friends.If you are not in academia, this is even more important. Having a PhD conveys gravitas, as does a .edu e-mail address. Is that fair? Maybe. Either way, if you don’t have either, many people will assume by default that you are a crank, especially in fields that attract controversy.But: if you can legitimately say that Dr. Marvin Bigshotte of The University For Special Clever Chaps has read your work, the editor may give your complaint a hearing.However, if you can’t find anyone in academia who’ll take you seriously, ask yourself why.Hint: It almost certainly isn’t a conspiracy against your bold and trenchant political stance. Very few academics are so corrupt that they won’t take half-decent scientific arguments into consideration.This especially helps when you have to…6. Ask someone you trust if you’re making senseThe midnight hour makes us all a bit weird, and if you’re up late hounding some problem you’ve dug out of a manuscript you’ve found, well, you might have lost the plot completely. The best indication that you’re making sense comes from other people. Ask them before you send things to the wider world.We’ve both made some severe errors in public by pointing out “obvious” errors in cases where we had simply missed that the authors had, in fact, taken everything into account. You can get away with this once or twice, but you need to keep your hit rate WAY above 50% to be taken seriously.The irony is: most of you have forgotten about these. But we haven’t. And you can’t police yourself. Enlist the help of people who’ll tell you you’re wrong.7. Don’t CC the entire worldIf you get a reputation as an iconoclast, even if it’s a sub-Z-grade reputation, people will start to treat you as a banner carrier. This means, apparently, that in any given dust-up it’s OK to suddenly cc you into random email chains which are the length of a Tolstoy novel and about as much fun.This is rude, and odd. The response to you doing this will be “I don’t know the first thing about the topic you’re roping me into, I don’t know you, and I don’t owe you anything.”Suddenly inserting members of the public into methodological criticism to be a passive audience doesn’t give you any cachet, it just grots up inboxes.8. Accept it when no-one cares, and move on.So you have a problem with something someone published, and you tried to get someone else to care, and they don’t. What should you do now? If your answer is SCREAM LOUDLY FOR YEARS then you fail. Minus ten points from Yellingdor.Basically, if you start by prosecuting your original arguments ineffectively, no-one will listen when you send them your 27th email.There’s a certain arrogance to this: you alienate people, and then having done that, you insist that they listen to you. There’s no engagement in these emails, they are just screaming I AM RIGHT over and over again.The moment someone thinks ‘oh, THIS again’ about something you’ve written you’ve already lost. You’ve lost the right for someone to take you seriously.This still applies if you “know” you are right, and indeed even if multiple independent experts in the field all confirm that they think you’re right too. Talk about it, shout about it, get people onside, but don’t be surprised when no-one cares.We have a heaving drawer full of serious, actual, real problems with scientific papers.

10033,3956733,2018-03-02 16:54:41,"About TNWTNW SitesThe ecommerce industry could be a lot better — here’s howEvery single day hundreds, if not millions of websites get successfully launched. A good number of them are ecommerce stores that try to sell everything from pins to planes. But, only a handful of them taste the success of the notoriety of the famed ones like Amazon, eBay, Etsy, and the likes.Almost every ecommerce entrepreneur begins his or her venture with the dazzling dream of becoming the next big giant. While the giants and their success stories have already given us much feed for coffee conversation, there is something that most of us, including the aspiring ecommerce entrepreneurs, fail to take notice of.Ecommerce has a lot of problems.Yup. You read that right. The much glorified and trillion-dollar market size boasting ecommerce industry does have its shortcomings. And, these shortcomings are becoming critical with the growth of automation led by AI and machine learning.I know that everybody’s a critic and just pointing out problems doesn’t get us anywhere. That’s why I’ve decided to outline the four major problems facing ecommerce and include what I think could help us solve them. These solutions should go a long way in making shopping not just a casual affair, but a relationship that goes beyond business transactions.Problem 1: It’s not ‘human’ enoughAdmit it. That joy of being personally attended and being helped by a sales assistant in a real store is missing in ecommerce. Even with chatbots for online shopping and AI-powered product suggestions, online shopping is not ‘human’ enough. It lacks a personal touch to it. Poorly designed websites with a slow loading speed and cluttered navigation only make things worse.Solution: Create engaging and personalized copyWell-thought and personalized website copy can help overcome the lack of a human connection. The copy should preferably be in a conversational tone, without being over salesy. Reading ‘Buy now, buy now, buy now!!” often would turn off your customers. Not just your website copy, even product descriptions must have a personal touch to make customers want them more. AO.com plays it neat with copywriting that shines with brilliance not in landing pages but also in product descriptions.Problem 2: Marketing is not persuasive enoughOn an average day, a working professional receives about 121 emails. Only a small portion of this staggering number is actually opened and read. Industry estimates cite a 18 percent open rate for marketing emails.The problem is that an opened email may not necessarily convert. If the marketing email is too salesy, or if it’s not aligned to the interests of the customer, or if it does not retarget a previously shown interest, then the marketing campaign is bound to fail. Personalization holds the key to marketing success.Solution: Create personalized campaignsYou need to care for customers like any other people you have a relationship with. Of course your relationship with a customer is based on his or her desire to pay you for your product or service offering. But, customers are people and they need to be treated as such, so the tendency of a large cross-section of ecommerce stores to looks at customers as mere numbers is unacceptable.The good news is that you can do better than your competition by treating customers like people, like in a true relationship. Personalized campaigns that are tailor-made to the customer’s needs and aspirations are the need of the hour.In fact, global brands like Starbucks have gone a step ahead to create everlasting customer relationships. The coffee brand sends their customer birthday wishes as well as issues them special offers or discount for the day. Truly a thoughtful way any business can treat its customers.Credit: Starbucks MelodyProblem 3: It’s facing cybersecurity threatsCybersecurity is more of a threat than a challenge to ecommerce. Even big players like Target, eBay, and Home Depot have been affected by cyber-attacks in the past. Despite the rise in mobile commerce by 20 percent and in-app payments by 55 percent, customers still have a fear lurking in their minds when it comes to making ecommerce payments. Online payment statistics report that at least 10 percent of customers still prefer a prepaid or gift card as the safest means.Imagine a 10 percent annual loss of business for an online store that does not accept prepaid or gift cards!?Of course, there are tons of online material that show how to safeguard your store from being hacked. Still, there is a need to assure customers that you are a secure website that they can share their private and payment information with.Solution: Display trust indicatorsCustomers want explicit proof that your website is a safe place to carry out online payment transactions. Trust indicators like HTTPS bar, authorized dealer badges, etc. on checkout pages will help customers feel at peace.Installing a SSL certificate will give the HTTPS prefix and a green address bar for your website. The HTTPS address bar is great since it signals your visitors that your website is safe to entrust information with. You can choose from Organizational Validation, Domain Validation, or Extended Validation certificate that will secure your website as well as boost customer confidence.There is a growing need to make ecommerce a digital fortress. Things are already looking up, thanks to Google, WordPress, and several other internet organizations that are driving the web towards a safer environment. HTTPS everywhere and similar movements are bound to make ecommerce more secure for customers.Problem 4: Brand engagement ends with the store websiteEcommerce is actually an incredibly broad term, despite the fact that we’ve come to accept it as the synonym for online shopping. There isn’t any major harm in this common misconception, but it has led retailers to limit themselves to selling on their websites — which is a mistake you should avoid.In today’s omnichannel world, this website-online business model can backfire. We live in a hyperconnected world where customers use more apps, social media, and instant messages more than anything else. Ecommerce has become closely tied with social networking and instant messaging. Unfortunately, not many retailers are leveraging social networking the way it should be. Despite a 133 percent higher conversion rate, social commerce in the US amounted to only five percent of the entire ecommerce market.Solution: Meet customers where they areYour ecommerce venture does not end with having a good website along. To thrive digitally it also needs to build a social media presence across multiple digital channels where customers frequent. Social media, has given birth to a whole new breed of ecommerce called social commerce. Image-sharing platforms Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, are turning into virtual POS outlets where customers can buy the products that they see and like.Zappos has a rather funky way of capturing the social crowd’s attention with its social media campaigns. You can get plenty of inspiration from their social media handles like Hootsuite, Oreo, and Gatorade. Credit: SocialatedEcommerce is great, but it could be awesomeEcommerce has come a long way from the classified looking home pages. On demand ordering and same day deliveries are shaping the next frontiers of ecommerce. Drones are all set to take over the delivery process and Amazon Go promises cashless checkout. All this and much more to feel great about online shopping.Nevertheless, it’s not foolproof and is riddled with some shortcomings like what I have tried to express in this blog. The industry as a whole needs an upheaval of sorts which customers and their shopping experience would be put right at the center.To sum it up, an ecommerce store that is humane and takes care of the wants and needs of its customers will leave any competitors in the dust.",The ecommerce industry could be a lot better — here’s how

10035,3959512,2018-02-14 21:17:17,"Nick Brown does not look like your average student. He's 53 for a start and at 6ft 4in with a bushy moustache and an expression that jackknifes between sceptical and alarmed, he is reminiscent of a mid-period John Cleese. He can even sound a bit like the great comedian when he embarks on an extended sardonic riff, which he is prone to do if the subject rouses his intellectual suspicion.A couple of years ago that suspicion began to grow while he sat in a lecture at the University of East London, where he was taking a postgraduate course in applied positive psychology. There was a slide showing a butterfly graph – the branch of mathematical modelling most often associated with chaos theory. On the graph was a tipping point that claimed to identify the precise emotional co-ordinates that divide those people who ""flourish"" from those who ""languish"".According to the graph, it all came down to a specific ratio of positive emotions to negative emotions. If your ratio was greater than 2.9013 positive emotions to 1 negative emotion you were flourishing in life. If your ratio was less than that number you were languishing.It was as simple as that. The mysteries of love, happiness, fulfilment, success, disappointment, heartache, failure, experience, random luck, environment, culture, gender, genes, and all the other myriad ingredients that make up a human life could be reduced to the figure of 2.9013.It seemed incredible to Brown, as though it had been made up. But the number was no invention. Instead it was the product of research that had been published, after peer review, in no less authoritative a journal than American Psychologist – the pre-eminent publication in the world of psychology that is delivered to every member of the American Psychological Association. Co-authored by Barbara Fredrickson and Marcial Losada and entitled Positive Affect and the Complex Dynamics of Human Flourishing, the paper was subsequently cited more than 350 times in other academic journals. And aside from one partially critical paper, no one had seriously questioned its validity.Masters student Nick Brown: 'If you want to be a whistleblower you have to be prepared to lose your job. I’m able to do what I’m doing here because I’m nobody.'Fredrickson is a distinguished psychologist, a professor at the University of North Carolina, a winner of several notable psychology awards and bestselling author of a number of psychology books, including Positivity, which took her and Losada's academic research and recast it for a mass audience – the subtitle ran ""Top-Notch Research Reveals the 3-to-1 Ratio That Will Change Your Life"".""Just as zero degrees celsius is a special number in thermodynamics,"" wrote Fredrickson in Positivity, ""the 3-to-1 positivity ratio may well be a magic number in human psychology.""Fredrickson is the object of widespread admiration in the field of psychology. Martin Seligman, former president of the American Psychological Association and a bestselling author in his own right, went so far as to call her ""the genius of the positive psychology movement"". On top of which she is also an associate editor at American Psychologist.By contrast, Brown was a first-term, first-year, part-time masters student who was about to take early retirement from what he calls a ""large international organisation"" in Strasbourg, where he had been head of IT network operations. Who was he to doubt the work of a leading professional which had been accepted by the psychological elite? What gave him the right to suggest that the emperor had gone naturist?""The answer,"" says Brown when I meet him in a north London cafe, ""is because that's how it always happens. Look at whistleblower culture. If you want to be a whistleblower you have to be prepared to lose your job. I'm able to do what I'm doing here because I'm nobody. I don't have to keep any academics happy. I don't have to think about the possible consequences of my actions for people I might admire personally who may have based their work on this and they end up looking silly. There are 160,000 psychologists in America and they've got mortgages. I've got the necessary degree of total independence.""Armed with that independence, he went away and looked at the maths that underpinned Fredrickson and Losada's ratio. Complex or non-linear dynamics are not easy for an untrained mathematician to understand, much less work out. Losada, who claimed expertise in non-linear dynamics, was working as a business consultant and making mathematical models of business team behaviour when he first met Fredrickson.In Positivity, Fredrickson describes the moment when Losada explained how he could apply complex dynamics to her theories of positive psychology. ""Hours into our lively discussion, he made a bold claim: based on his mathematical work, he could locate the exact positivity ratio that would distinguish those who flourished from those who didn't.""So impressed was she by this boast that Fredrickson arranged a sabbatical from her teaching duties ""so I could immerse myself in the science of dynamic systems that Marcial had introduced me to"".There were several psychologists, versed in non-linear dynamics, who smelt something fishy about the maths in the published paper. Stephen Guastello, from Marquette University, wrote a note of mild complaint to American Psychologist, which it chose not to publish because ""there wasn't enough interest in the article"". Guastello feels now that he should have been more forceful in his opinions. ""In retrospect,"" he says, ""I see how I could have been more clearly negative and less supportive of what looked like an article that could move the field forward if someone would follow up with some strong empirical work.""John Gottman, a leading authority in the psychology of successful relationships, wrote to Losada because he couldn't follow the equations. ""I thought it was something I didn't know about, because he's a smart guy, Losada. He never answered my email,"" he says. Gottman also wrote to Fredrickson. ""She said she didn't understand the math either.""""Not many psychologists are very good at maths,"" says Brown. ""Not many psychologists are even good at the maths and statistics you have to do as a psychologist. Typically you'll have a couple of people in the department who understand it. Most psychologists are not capable of organising a quantitative study. A lot of people can get a PhD in psychology without having those things at their fingertips. And that's the stuff you're meant to know. Losada's maths were of the kind you're not meant to encounter in psychology. The maths you need to understand the Losada system is hard but the maths you need to understand that this cannot possibly be true is relatively straightforward.""Brown had studied maths to A-level and then took a degree in engineering and computer science at Cambridge. ""But I actually gave up the engineering because the maths was too hard,"" he says, laughing at the irony. ""So I'm really not that good at maths. I can read simple calculus but I can't solve differential equations. But then neither could Losada!""He went back over Losada's equations and he noticed that if he put in the numbers Fredrickson and Losada had then you could arrive at the appropriate figures. But he realised that it only worked on its own terms. ""When you look at the equation, it doesn't contain any data. It's completely self-referential.""Unfortunately, while his grasp of maths was strong enough to see the problem, it wasn't sufficiently firm to be able to mount an academic takedown of Fredrickson's and Losada's work. Yet that was what he wanted to do. Once he knew to his own satisfaction that their research was fundamentally flawed, he was not going to be content to let things pass. So he decided to seek the help of an academic mathematician. Not just any academic mathematician either, but one who had made a name for himself by puncturing the bogus use of maths and science in another discipline.Back in 1996, Alan Sokal wrote a paper called Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity and submitted it to an academic cultural studies journal called Social Text, which promptly published the article. As the title suggested, the paper was dense with impenetrable theory. Among other things, it disparaged the scientific method and western intellectual hegemony and claimed that quantum gravity could only be understood through its political context.The paper, as Sokal quickly admitted, was a hoax, a deliberate pastiche of the sorts of nonsensical postmodern appropriations of maths and physics at which French critical theorists particularly excelled – among them Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan, Gilles Deleuze and Julia Kristeva. A major intellectual controversy ensued in which postmodernists stood accused of pseudo-science, absurd cultural relativism and the concealing of ignorance and innumeracy behind obscurantist prose. In response Sokal was derided as a pedant, a literalist and a cultural imperialist.Despite the counterattacks, Sokal gained a reputation as a formidable enemy of bad science. As such he was regularly approached by people who believed they had uncovered an intellectual imposture, be it in architecture, history or musicology.""I don't think I'm a crank,"" Brown had said in his email to Sokal. ""I am just this grad student with no qualifications or credentials, starting out in the field. I don't know how to express this kind of idea especially coherently in academic written form, and I suspect that even if I did, it would be unlikely to be published.""But like many such requests, it began to disappear beneath a pile of other emails. It was only several weeks later that Sokal came across it again and realised that on this occasion he could help because it was in a field he knew something about: mathematics and physics.""The Lorenz equation Losada used was from fluid dynamics,"" says Sokal, ""which is not the field that I'm specialised in, but it's elementary enough that any mathematician or physicist knows enough. In 10 seconds I could see it was total bullshit. Nick had written a very long critique and basically it was absolutely right. There were some points where he didn't quite get the math right but essentially Nick had seen everything that was wrong with the Losada and Fredrickson paper.""Sokal did a little research and was amazed at the standing the Fredrickson and Losada paper enjoyed. ""I don't know what the figures are in psychology but I know that in physics having 350 citations is a big deal,"" he says. ""Look on Google you get something like 27,000 hits. This theory is not just big in academia, there's a whole industry of coaching and it intersects with business and business schools. There's a lot of money in it.""The concept of positive thinking dates back at least as far as the ancient Greeks. Throughout written history, metaphysicians have grappled with questions of happiness and free will. The second-century Stoic sage Epictetus argued that ""Your will needn't be affected by an incident unless you let it"". In other words, we can be masters and not victims of fate because what we believe our capability to be determines the strength of that capability.In one way or another, positive thinking has always been concerned with optimising human potential, which is a key component of psychology. But in the 20th century, confronting the great traumas of two annihilating wars, the psychology profession became increasingly focused on the dysfunctional and pathological aspects of the human mind. The emphasis was on healing the ill rather than improving the well.So it was left to popular or amateur psychology, and in particular that sector specialising in business success, to accentuate the positive. Books such as Norman Vincent Peale's The Power of Positive Thinking, published in 1952, became huge bestsellers. By the 1970s and 1980s, self-help had mushroomed into a vast literary genre that encompassed everything from the secrets of material achievement to the new age promises of chakras, reiki and self-realisation.On becoming president of the American Psychological Association in 1998, Martin Seligman set out to bring scientific rigour to the issue of self-improvement. In his inaugural speech, he announced a shift in psychology towards a ""new science of human strengths"".Barbara Frederickson, associate editor of American Psychologist, accepts the errors in the maths that Nick Brown pointed out, but still stands by her theory of positivity.""It's my belief,"" said Seligman, ""that since the end of the second world war, psychology has moved too far away from its original roots, which were to make the lives of all people more fulfilling and productive, and too much toward the important, but not all-important, area of curing mental illness.""He called for ""a reoriented science that emphasises the understanding and building of the most positive qualities of an individual"". It was an optimistic period in American history. The economy was buoyant, US geopolitical power was unchallenged and no major conflicts were raging. As a result, there was almost a messianic note of global ambition in Seligman's address. ""We can show the world what actions lead to wellbeing, to positive individuals, to flourishing communities, and to a just society,"" he declared.Suddenly a plethora of positive psychology books began to appear, written by eminent psychologists. There was Flow: The Psychology of Happiness by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who with Seligman is seen as the co-founder of the modern positive psychology movement; Authentic Happiness: Using the New Positive Psychology to Realise Your Potential for Lasting Fulfilment by Seligman himself. And of course Fredrickson's Positivity, approved by both Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi. Each of them appeared to quote and promote one another, creating a virtuous circle of recommendation.And these books were not only marketed like a previous generation of self-help manuals, they often shared the same style of cod-sagacious prose. ""Positivity opens your mind naturally, like the water lily that opens with sunlight,"" writes Fredrickson in Positivity.Then there was the lucrative lecture circuit. Both Seligman and Fredrickson are hired speakers. One website lists Seligman's booking fee at between $30,000 and $50,000 an engagement. In this new science of happiness, it seemed that all the leading proponents were happy.But then Nick Brown started to ask questions.Around the time Brown first came across Fredrickson's work, a case came to light in Holland in which a psychologist called Diederik Stapel, who was dean of faculty at Tilburg University, was caught by his graduate students making up data. It turned out he'd been falsifying his research for the previous 15 years. Brown, who is currently translating Stapel's autobiography, got in touch with him and asked him why he did it.""The way he describes it,"" says Brown, ""is that the environment was conducive to it. He said, 'I could either do the hard work or put my hand in the jar and take out a biscuit'."" It does a massive amount of harm to science when this sort of thing happens. Nobody's accusing Fredrickson of making anything up. She just basically invented her own method. Is that worse than inventing your own data?""After he had established contact with Sokal, Brown sent him a 15,000-word draft, which was much too long for publication. At first the professor agreed to give Brown advice on cleaning up the draft. He also told him that he should go to American Psychologist, and he contributed a pedagogic section, explaining the maths.""I still wasn't thinking that I was going to be a co-author but Nick sent me drafts and I just liked his writing style,"" recalls Sokal. ""It made me laugh. He had this gift for English understatement.""Getting their critique of Fredrickson into the publication of which she was an associate editor was a tall order. To help him get across the line, Brown had already recruited Harris Friedman, a sympathetic psychologist who had doubts about Fredrickson's claims but was not sufficiently versed in maths to make a case on his own.Sending revised versions back and forth among themselves, the three men gradually composed what they considered to be a watertight argument. The initial title they submitted to American Psychologist was The Complex Dynamics of an Intellectual Imposture – an ironic play on Fredrickson and Losada's original piece. That was rejected by the editor because he argued that the word ""imposture"" implied a deliberate fraud on the part of Fredrickson and Losada.Sokal insists that this was never their intention. As Brown puts it in characteristic manner. ""This particular paper wasn't an act of fraud and it wasn't about statistics. It's that someone had a brain-fart one day.""Following much negotiation, Brown, Sokal and Friedman had their paper accepted by American Psychologist and it was published online last July under the only slightly less provocative title of The Complex Dynamics of Wishful Thinking. Referring to the bizarrely precise tipping point ratio of 2.9013 that Fredrickson and Losada trumpeted applied to all humans regardless of age, gender, race or culture, the authors – in fact Brown, in this sentence – wrote: ""The idea that any aspect of human behaviour or experience should be universally and reproducibly constant to five significant digits would, if proven, constitute a unique moment in the history of the social sciences.""The paper mounted a devastating case against the maths employed by Fredrickson and Losada, who were offered the chance to respond in the same online issue of American Psychologist. Losada declined and has thus far failed to defend his input in any public forum. But Fredrickson did write a reply, which, putting a positive spin on things, she titled Updated Thinking on Positivity Ratios.She effectively accepted that Losada's maths was wrong and admitted that she never really understood it anyway. But she refused to accept that the rest of the research was flawed. Indeed she claimed that, if anything, the empirical evidence was even stronger in support of her case. Fredrickson subsequently removed the critical chapter that outlines Losada's input from further editions of Positivity. She has avoided speaking to much of the press but in an email exchange with me, she maintained that ""on empirical grounds, yes, tipping points are highly probable"" in relation to positive emotions and flourishing.""She's kind of hoping the Cheshire cat has disappeared but the grin is still there,"" says Brown, who is dismissive of Fredrickson's efforts at damage limitation. ""She's trying to throw Losada over the side without admitting that she got conned. All she can really show is that higher numbers are better than lower ones. What you do in science is you make a statement of what you think will happen and then run the experiment and see if it matches it. What you don't do is pick up a bunch of data and start reading tea leaves. Because you can always find something. If you don't have much data you shouldn't go round theorising. Something orange is going to happen to you today, says the astrology chart. Sure enough, you'll notice if an orange bicycle goes by you.""But social psychology is full of theorising and much of it goes unquestioned. This is particularly the case when the research involves, as it does with Fredrickson, self-report, where the subjects assess themselves.As John Gottman says: ""Self-report data is easier to obtain, so a lot of social psychologists have formed an implicit society where they won't challenge one another. It's a collusion that makes it easier to publish research and not look at observational data or more objective data.""In general, says Gottman, the results of self-report have been quite reliable in the area of wellbeing. The problem is that when it comes down to distinguishing, say, those who ""languish"" from those who ""flourish"", there may be all manner of cultural and personal reasons why an individual or group might wish to deny negative feelings or even downplay positive ones.""It's a lot more complicated than Fredrickson is suggesting,"" says Gottman.After initially being turned down, Brown, Sokal and Friedman went through American Psychologist's lengthy appeals procedure and won the right to reply to Fredrickson's reply. They are currently working on what is certain to be a very carefully considered response. But it doesn't take a psychologist to work out that, given the nature of human behaviour, it's unlikely to be the last word.",The British amateur who debunked the mathematics of happiness
10036,3959518,2018-03-01 13:00:00,"Researchers say bad engineering, not a deliberate attack, may be to blamePhoto: Alexandre Meneghini/Reuters Sonic Mystery: At least 24 employees of the U.S. embassy in Cuba heard high-pitched sounds between December 2016 and August 2017, and suffered injuries thought to be related to the noise.Last August, reports emerged that U.S. and Canadian diplomats in Cuba had suffered a host of mysterious ailments. Speculation soon arose that a high-frequency sonic weapon was to blame. Acoustics experts, however, were quick to point out the unlikeliness of such an attack. Among other things, ultrasonic frequencies—from 20 to 200 kilohertz—don’t propagate well in air and don’t cause the ear pain, headache, dizziness, and other symptoms reported in Cuba. Also, some victims recalled hearing high-pitched sounds, whereas ultrasound is inaudible to humans.The mystery deepened in October, when the Associated Press (AP) released a 6-second audio clip, reportedly a recording of what U.S. embassy staff heard. The chirping tones, centered around 7 kHz, were indeed audible, but they didn’t suggest any kind of weapon.“Given all the possible explanations, this definitely seems the most plausible and the most technically feasible” —Fadel Adib, MITLooking at a spectral plot of the clip on YouTube, Kevin Fu, a computer scientist at the University of Michigan, noted some unusual ripples. He thought he might know what they meant.Fu’s lab specializes in analyzing the cybersecurity of devices connected to the Internet of Things, such as sensors, pacemakers, RFIDs, and autonomous vehicles. That work has taught him that modern electronics often behave in unpredictable ways and that such devices can be manipulated—intentionally or inadvertently—using carefully crafted acoustic or radio interference. To Fu, the ripples in the spectral readout suggested some kind of interference.He discussed the AP clip with his frequent collaborator, Wenyuan Xu, a professor at Zhejiang University, in Hangzhou, China, and her Ph.D. student Chen Yan. “We saw it as an interesting puzzle,” says Xu, whose lab works on embedded security, including the use of ultrasound and radio waves to fool voice-recognition systems and self-driving cars. “It was a lot of fun to try to solve it.”“I thought it might be subharmonics,” Fu recalls. “But a week later, Chen said, ‘No, Kevin, you’re wrong, and I just did an experiment to prove it.’ ”Yan and Xu started with a fast Fourier transform of the AP audio, which revealed the signal’s exact frequencies and amplitudes. Then, through a series of simulations, Yan showed that an effect known as intermodulation distortion could have produced the AP sound. Intermodulation distortion occurs when two signals having different frequencies combine to produce synthetic signals at the difference, sum, or multiples of the original frequencies.When signal processing equipment behaves in a nonlinear way, it can cause this type of distortion. For example, Fu says, microphone circuitry can exhibit nonlinear behavior, and waves propagating through air can also behave in a nonlinear fashion. “As acoustic waves containing multiple frequencies travel through a nonlinear system, you can get these bizarre ripples in the spectrum of the signal,” he explains. “At the same time, intermodulation distortion can produce lower-frequency signals than the original signals. In other words, inaudible ultrasonic waves going through air can produce audible by-⁠products.”Yan followed up the simulations with lab experiments, in which he used two ultrasonic speakers, one emitting a signal at 25 kHz and the other at 32 kHz. When he crossed the two signals, it produced the telltale high-pitched sound at 7 kHz, which was equal to the difference between the two speakers’ frequencies—and the same frequency as in the AP audio. In a nod to the Internet meme “rickrolling,” Yan was even able to embed an ultrasonic version of the Rick Astley song “Never Gonna Give You Up,” which became audible at the point where the two signals crossed.Having reverse engineered the AP audio, Fu, Xu, and Yan then considered what combination of things might have caused the sound at the U.S. embassy in Cuba. “If ultrasound is to blame, then a likely cause was two ultrasonic signals that accidentally interfered with each other, creating an audible side effect,” Fu says. There are existing sources of ultrasound in office environments, such as room-occupancy sensors [see, for example, “How an Ultrasonic Sensor Nearly Derailed a Ph.D. Thesis”]. “Maybe there was also an ultrasonic jammer in the room and an ultrasonic transmitter,” he suggests. “Each device might have been placed there by a different party, completely unaware of the other.”One thing the investigation didn’t explore was whether the AP audio could have produced the wide range of symptoms, including brain damage, that afflicted embassy workers. “We know that audible signals can cause pain, but we didn’t look at the physiological effects beyond that,” Fu says. At press time, the FBI had yet to announce the results of its investigation. A panel of Cuban scientists and medical doctors, meanwhile, concluded that a “collective psychogenic disorder” brought on by stress may have been at work.Fadel Adib, a professor at MIT who specializes in wireless technology for sensing and communications, calls the study by Fu and his colleagues “a creative take on what might have happened.” Adib, who wasn’t involved in the research but reviewed the results, adds that wireless signals can and do interact with one another. “And if that happens, you’ll hear signals you wouldn’t expect to hear,” he says. “Given all the possible explanations, this definitely seems the most plausible and the most technically feasible.”Fu is careful to offer a caveat: “Of course, we don’t know for certain this was the cause. But bad engineering just seems much more likely than a sonic weapon.”This article appears in the March 2018 print issue as “Reverse Engineering the ‘Sonic Weapon.’ ”Editor’s note: An article by Kevin Fu, Wenyuan Xu, and Chen Yan about their research will be published by IEEE Spectrum in March. Their technical report, “On Cuba, Diplomats, Ultrasound, and Intermodulation Distortion,” is available on the Security and Privacy Group’s website [PDF].","Finally, a Likely Explanation for the “Sonic Weapon” Used at the U.S. Embassy in Cuba"
10037,3962321,2018-03-04 18:16:36,"Snapchat is stuck in the uncanny valley of AR glasses0“Timing”, Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel said cryptically when asked what the greatest threat was for Snap Inc. “I think the big risks are always the really big product ideas that we’re investing in that are just hard to get right” he told the Goldman Sachs conference two weeks ago.The statements got lost amongst flashier quotes. He defended the Snapchat redesign saying “Even the complaints we’re seeing reinforce the philosophy”, and described Snap’s office atmosphere as “just below the boil…. Like when you heat water, and it’s really fucking hot, but it’s just below the boil.”Yet it’s his thoughts on ‘timing’ that give us the deepest insight into Snapchat’s toughest problem: overcoming reality.“I think if we look at the future, there’s a lot of different components to what we’re trying to accomplish and timing is an important one of those — especially in the technology business, both in terms of consumers’ willingness to try new products, but also in terms of technological development and what that can power in a set amount of time. As I’m looking at the next decade, big products that we’re trying to develop, I think timing is a funny thing. That’s probably what I’ll have my eye on as we just continue to try to develop products, and we’re willing to wait to get ’em right but that’s probably the risk.”For Snap, no idea is bigger than building augmented reality glasses that pack world-morphing features into a stylish form factor. I believe this is what Spiegel was hinting at. He knows Snap is mired in an uncanny valley between the lackluster truth of today’s augmented reality hardware, and the desireable AR gadgets that are years beyond our current engineering prowess.The fact is that no one has been able to build this. Google Glass flopped with consumers and pivoted to the enterprise. Magic Leap’s bulky headset requires a backpack or beltpack to power it, and is still just a rendering. Facebook has nothing to show and Apple has kept anything it’s tinkering with secret. Intel’s Vaunt glasses are perhaps the closest — small and stylish, but merely delivering text notifications and directions projected onto your retina.We’re still a long way from compact AR glasses that can overlay virtual objects onto the real world the way Snapchat’s smartphone app does. Perhaps years. And that’s the “timing” risk Spiegel described. Snap might be willing to wait, or more accurately, forced to wait. But the public markets might not be so patient, and bigger, better funded hardware-first companies are racing for the prize.Just how slow Snapchat is inching towards the goal was revealed yesterday by Alex Heath of Cheddar’s stellar scoop on the future of Snap Spectacles. He reports that Snap is preparing to launch v2 of Spectacles later this year and v3 in 2019. But they won’t deliver on the fever dream of AR glasses that seamlessly alter our lives.v1 of Spectacles emerged in Fall 2016 with a way to record circular first-person video from a camera built into frame. But getting the videos off the glasses and into your phone in high resolution proved a buggy hassle. Despite a hyped up launch with lines outside its Snap Bot vending machines in surprise locations, their utility was limited.Word of a new version of Spectacles might surprise some. Leaked data showed less than half of owners kept using them after a month with many ditching Spectacles after just a week. The best camera is the one you have with you. But between recharging via proprietary cable, their fragility, and their bulky triangular case, people rarely had their Spectacles when they needed them. Snap only sold about 150,000 pairs, with hundreds of thousands lying unsold in warehouses, and it registered a $40 million write-off on the hardware business.After 2 years of improvements, Spectacles v2 will reportedly be…water resistant, available in new colors, and have fewer bugs. That’s little progress in a long time. And the launch has already missed internal deadlines.v3 is due in 2019 and is supposed to be a little more ambitious with two cameras to add 3D depth effects to the videos they record. But that’s still a far cry from us digitally hallucinating a dancing hot dog through Spectacles themselves.This all brings the “timing” problem into focus. Snapchat claims to be a “camera company” but doesn’t make smartphones, which everyone uses as cameras. It’s done plenty with just software, bringing augmented reality to the masses through puppy ears and rainbow puke. Still, the world is waiting for AR glasses, and Snap can’t make them yet.What it has built, and what’s on its now-revealed roadmap for the next two years, doesn’t cut it. The concept known as the “uncanny valley” explains our revulsion to humanoid objects such as androids, life-like dolls, and 3D animation that don’t convincingly appear human. You’d expect that the more human-esque something looks, the more warmly we’d receive it. But in fact our positive perception drops into a valley until something reaches a high threshold of accuracy in mimicking humans.I believe Snapchat is stuck in the uncanny valley of AR glasses. At the start of the spectrum are our smartphones. They can produce somewhat convincing augmented reality…as long as you suspend your disbelief triggered by holding your phone in front of your face. At the far end are the AR glasses we imagine, which look just like normal glasses or even contact lenses, but that can overlay convincing AR objects on our view such that we can’t tell they’re not real.In the middle are Snapchat Spectacles, with all the stigma attached. Beyond shooting circular video from the first-person perspective, they’re arguably much worse cameras than our phones. Poor resolution, limited battery life, video-only, tough to export from, can’t take selfies, and they lack the auto-stabilized swiveling gimbals that are our hands.And from a form factor standpoint, they’re obtrusive, literally putting a barrier between us and everyone else, while scaring them that we might be recording. Unless they elevate you to having technological super-powers, which they don’t, they inhibit your ability to interact with humanity. If you wear Spectacles, you might get called a glasshole. Meanwhile your phone is always with you, but resides humbly in your pocket or purse.As described, Spectacles v2 and v3 won’t change this equation. That’s why I’d be surprised if they sell well enough to become a serious hardware business for Snap, or deliver enough unique content to boost Snapchat usage.The company’s irreverent brand and roguish design aesthetic let it get away with unpolished products that would never meet Apple’s standards. Still, Snap will likely have to spend years and billions of dollars to get to a v5 or v6 of Spectacles that are able to claw their way out of the uncanny valley. It may be running short on both time and money.Snap lost $350 million last quarter and $3.5 billion in 2017. It’s got just $2 billion in cash and securities in the bank. Facebook is waging total war on Snapchat, cloning its features, blocking its user growth, and jockeying for its vertical video ad dollars. By the time Snap gets to viable AR Spectacles, the company founded in 2011 could be ten years old and starting to lose its luster with the next generation of teens. And each day, Apple, Google, or another hardware giant gets closer to launching their own market-defining glasses.Snapchat is and has always been in Spiegel’s hands, between his voting rights and product instincts. If he’s compelled to bet Snap’s future on AR glasses, no one can dissuade him. But the timeline of pure technological progress is one thing beyond the CEO’s control. As I wrote when assessing the potential of Snap’s IPO, it all comes down to “do you believe in Evan Spiegel?” When he says “timing” is the company’s biggest risk, expect that Snap could spend an excruciatingly long sentence locked in the valley.",Snapchat is stuck in the uncanny valley of AR glasses
