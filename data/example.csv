3829,4192,Timothy B. Lee,2017-09-26 21:50:28,Twitter thinks 140 characters might be too constraining for English writers.,none,2017-09-26T21:50:28Z,0.919805589307412,ars-technica,"The 140-character limit is Twitter's defining feature and also its most controversial. Critics say that it makes the service confining and unfriendly to new users. Defenders say that enforced brevity is what makes the service so useful.Twitter is considering doubling the limit. In a Tuesday blog post, Twitter announced that a limited number of users will be given the ability to use up to 280 characters in a tweet.It might seem like expanding the limit will only cause people to pack more information in to each tweet. But Twitter argues that's not actually the case. They point to the experience of Japanese, where a richer character set means that you can say more with fewer characters. Japanese users are subject to the same 140-character limit English users are, but they find the limit much less constraining:While nine percent of English tweets use the full 140 characters, less than one percent of tweets in Japan are that long. This suggests that doubling the character limit for tweets will allow English users to express themselves more comfortably—without creating a temptation to create long, un-Twitter-like screeds.Twitter plans to make the change for all languages other than Chinese, Japanese, and Korean—languages whose large character sets make the increase unnecessary.The increase is ""only available to a small group right now,"" Twitter says. The company is going to evaluate the results from this trial before deciding whether to expand the character limit for all Twitter users.When rumors swirled last year that Twitter might expand the character limit to 10,000 characters, Ars Technica's own Peter Bright wrote a magnificent screed against the proposal.""The 140-character limit is not merely some incidental feature of Twitter; it's the very essence of the service,"" Bright wrote. ""The mandate to be concise means that Twitter distinguishes itself from abundant conventional blogging platforms. Tweets can be observations, jokes, questions, or carefully distilled ideas, but they cannot be lengthy treatises or complex arguments.""Bright isn't a fan of the 280-character expansion, either. In a Slack conversation today, he called it a ""weird nothingburger"" that would break third-party clients without solving any real problems with the platform.Timothy B.

The result may not surprise anybody familiar with how much data free online services gather about their users, but it may be the most vivid personal identifier (PID) disclosure yet from the popular dating app.Duportail's frank article at the Guardian makes no bones about her dating history over the past few years. That detail is provided in part to describe just how much sensitive information appeared in the massive 800-page report that Tinder sent her. Much of the data was sourced primarily from Tinder itself, including complete message histories and geolocation data for every interaction on the app, while other data was sourced from linked accounts at Facebook and Instagram. Duportail does not go into granular detail about which parts of her Facebook and Instagram profiles were included, but she says Tinder tracked all of her Facebook ""likes"" and stored her Instagram photos even after she had de-linked that photo-sharing account from her Tinder profile.Data researcher and PersonalData.io co-founder Paul-Olivier Dehaye took to his Twitter account to confirm that the process of retrieving Duportail's data from Tinder was exhaustive. ""It took real involvement of one data protection activist (me) and a human rights lawyer for them to answer,"" Dehaye wrote. ""Two [data protection directive] complaints, dozens of e-mails, months of waiting. Far from easy!""Tuesday's data dump included over 1,700 messages sent and received by Duportail, which she points out before mentioning Tinder's formerly casual terms of service attitude about such messaging: ""You should not expect that your personal information, chats, or other communications will always remain secure."" (Tinder has since updated its TOS to remove that statement, along with statements about PID being used for the sake of ""targeted advertising,"" but those phrases were in the TOS up until March of this year.) She expressed concerns over exactly how secure that data is, either in the face of a security breach or in the event of Tinder ever being sold.When Duportail asked Tinder why the service needed access to so much of its users' personally identifying information, a Tinder representative told her it was used ""to personalize the experience for each of our users around the world... Our matching tools are dynamic and consider various factors when displaying potential matches in order to personalize the experience for each of our users.""

The top-down cyberpunk shooter from Reikon Games pretty much demands the fluidity of twin-stick control, even at the cost of mouse-and-keyboard precision. And by ""demands,"" I mean the game kicked my head in six ways 'til Sunday before I realized the optimal way to play.The harshness of the action is telegraphed by the harshness of Ruiner's tone. The game's world is as red as Carrie on prom night and puts about as much value on human life. An opening crawl of text warns you that this dystopian future is as much about malice as mega-corporate profit—that hacking into people's brains and messing up their lives ""has never been more fun.""That form actually gets in the way of function, at times. Mostly red bullets are guided by red laser lights to produce red blood over red metal floors from enemies and weapons highlighted in red. Throw in the odd explosion or glitchy screen static as your character's brain gets hacked and the action can sometimes get impossible to read. Thankfully, that action is smooth enough to compensate for these occasional problems (so long as you're playing with a controller).KILL BOSS... and then someAll that action isn't muddied with plot, either. Ruiner drops your nameless, faceless avatar into a densely guarded corporate hideout. Your objective to ""KILL BOSS"" crackles harshly over the screen and airwaves on repeat. Things escalate when a miniboss fight forces you to juggle a timer, which extends every time you kill an enemy, along with dodging shotgun and assault rifle fire.Dodging is your first and most essential ability, but it is by no means your last. You earn skill points by leveling up through combat, side quests, and finding XP in chests strewn about stages. You can spend those skill points on new abilities, like letting you dash more times in a row without resting or slowing down time at the continuous cost of energy.Action in Ruiner is fast, twitchy, and mean.""Her"" is the source of most of the game's exposition.All the red flashing across the screen can be awfully hard to read. This isn't even close to the worst example.""Weapon grinders"" will convert unused weapons into XP after battle. So you're incentivized to do without.I wish Ruiner surfaced my old scores so I could go back and try to beat them.That's not gonna work out for you.Rengkok isn't huge, but it's nice enough to rest your head at between hectic missions.An in-game glossary is there for people who really want more story.Ruiner's sleek, smooth graphics belie its coarse music and tone.Once you get some skill points under your belt, choosing a loadout is like a game unto itself.I might have done poorly on this mission.What you might not guess is that skill points can be redistributed for free, on the fly, into any ability. This means you can not only tailor your own play style, but you can continue to tweak that style without fear of penalties. This flexibility lends a puzzle-game layer to the shooter, as you try to reason out the best skill mix to handle new enemies and bosses through trial and error.Puzzling out how to best handle the constantly changing rhythms and lineups of enemies quickly became half the fun for me, as I theory-crafted my LED-masked avenger to my heart's content. The other half of the fun came from ducking and weaving, prioritizing which target in a given wave of enemies to blast, and deciding which of their dropped weapons to use for a few rounds.Fast friends and harsh realityA handful of fights, especially boss battles, require a hard set of skills to proceed. Ruiner nudges you in the right direction in these cases through ""Her."" This mysterious, totally-trustworthy-we-promise woman acts as guide and narrator between missions in the hubworld-ish city of Rengkok, where most of the story gets teased out through disembodied transmissions and indices in the main menu.But Ruiner is more about style than exposition. The red decor bleeds into title cards introducing each new enemy. Industrially compressed Inception horns punctuate scene changes. Neon ads reflect over our 99-percent silent hero's mask before it breaks out in a message straight from Cyber City Oedo 808.With all that harsh style, a driving techno soundtrack—not to mention the fact that it's published by Devolver Digital—it's hard not to compare Ruiner to Hotline Miami. But where the 2012 cult hit was about planning raids on rooms full of enemies, playing Ruiner is more reactive.You can take a hit or two here, and you most definitely will. Gunfire moves faster than you do, naturally, so you end up tracing bullets back to their source and determining fluid paths through levels based on where those bullets aren't. Those narrow avenues then twist and warp depending on what ranged and melee weapons enemies drop. Fights are an overwhelming blend of twitch reactions to the battlefield that requires frequent rewriting of strategies on the fly, which makes it all immensely gratifying every time you overcome it.Piece it togetherRuiner isn't quitebullet hell, a puzzle game, an RPG, or bog-standard shooter. It borrows from all these genres but binds them with commitment to style. For most of its 8 to 10 hours, that identity holds Ruiner together as something more than the sum of its parts.There were a couple of moments when the game's commitment to crimson got in the way of that careful mix, but, like the levels themselves, I got better at reading it over time. Ruiner currently lacks any kind of colorblind mode or even just the ability to customize the UI, so make your buying decision accordingly based on whether those screenshots seem interpretable to you.Another glaring omission is any kind of mode to put Ruiner's slick combat to infinite use. Your performance is graded at the end of every mission and every encounter therein, but the scores aren't displayed anywhere. I could take my skilled-up character back to previous levels to do better, but, without any obvious record of my accomplishments, there's little compulsion to do so. That means I probably won't be trying that first hour of the game with a controller any time soon.Something like daily challenges or a boss rush mode might also fill the game's replay gap. ""I just want more Ruiner to play"" isn't the worst problem to have, though—for me or the game. As it is, this tight, linear package is still plenty of intense fun on its own.The GoodHarsh cyberpunk aesthetic never lightens up, never gets oldSatisfying combat calculations come together and execute smoothlyEndless tinkering with skill builds lets you build your own play stylesThe BadYou definitely need a controller to play if you're buying on PCA lack of repeat modes like time trials, a boss rush, or daily challengesToo much red makes the action hard to read at timesThe UglyBeing constantly reminded of our corporate-run dystopiaVerdict: Ruiner has a lot in common with other top-down action games but blends bits of all of them into a uniquely demanding, satisfying shooter.

While it amounts to a mere privilege-escalation bug—as opposed to a more critical code-execution flaw—several characteristics make it particularly potent. For one, the vulnerability is located in a part of the Linux kernel that's almost universally available. And for another, reliable exploits are relatively easy to develop.Further ReadingBy the time it was disclosed, it was already under active exploit on Linux servers. Within days of its disclosure, researchers and hobbyists were using the vulnerability, indexed as CVE-2016-5195, to root Android phones.Now, more than 1,200 apps available in third-party marketplaces are exploiting Dirty Cow as part of a scam that uses text-based payment services to make fraudulent charges to the phone owner, researchers from antivirus provider Trend Micro reported on Monday. The apps, which Trend Micro has detected on 5,000 devices in 40 countries, exploit Dirty Cow to overcome system restrictions and plant a backdoor that gives attackers a way to access the device for future attacks. Although Dirty Cow can be reliably exploited on just about any hardware platform, the exploit Trend Micro documented works only on Android devices with ARM/X86 64-bit architecture. Trend Micro said the apps are members of a family called ZNIU. The security company has published a list of malicious apps here.To be sure, there are no reports of apps available in the official Google Play market exploiting Dirty Cow. What's more, most of the infections are taking place in China and India. Still, attacks in third-party marketplaces can sometimes foreshadow what's likely to come in Google Play. And while Google released a patch for Dirty Cow last December, it's not clear what percentage of devices are eligible to receive it. Researcher David Manouchehri said it's likely any phone running Android version 5.1.1 or earlier is susceptible, and even phones running later versions may be, too. Based on figures supplied by Google, that would leave at least half of devices vulnerable. Google officials weren't able to provide an estimate of how many devices are patched.Google-branded phones—including the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Android One, Pixel C, Nexus Player, Pixel, and Pixel XL—should all be immune to attacks, assuming users are installing over-the-air updates on a regular basis.

3834,4197,Cathleen O'Grady,2017-09-26 18:26:49,"“Broken windows” policing might lead to more crime, but it’s complicated.",none,2017-09-26T18:26:49Z,0.9659184007864984,ars-technica,"NYC cops did a work stop, yet crime dropped“Broken windows” policing might lead to more crime, but it’s complicated.In late 2014 and early 2015, escalating tensions in New York City led to the NYPD staging a slowdown in which the department performed only its most essential duties. That might be expected to lead to an increase in crime, but a new analysis of official statistics shows the opposite: a significant drop in major crime for the period of the slowdown. Researchers are now arguing about what this tells us.The slowdown developed in response to a sequence of events following the death of Eric Garner in July 2014, who died when placed in a chokehold by the police officers who were arresting him. This led to extensive protests, which continued after the decision of a grand jury not to indict the officers involved in Garner’s death. Two weeks after that ruling, NYPD officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were fatally shot by an anti-police extremist, and the NYPD responded by informally and collectively stepping back their policing to the bare minimum.This included fewer tickets and a huge drop in arrests. The action was partly attributed to precautionary measures, but there were also political motivations: “The act was a symbolic show of strength to demonstrate the city’s dependence on the NYPD,” write criminologists Christopher M. Sullivan and Zachary P. O’Keeffe in a paper in Nature Human Behaviour this week.During the slowdown, police continued to respond to calls, and the arrest rate for major crimes (murder, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny, and grand theft auto) remained constant. But the arrest rate for non-major crime and narcotic offenses dropped, as did the number of stop-and-frisk events. It took until mid-January for things to begin to return to normal.Events like these provide rare opportunities to explore questions that couldn’t be tested experimentally, for practical or ethical reasons. So Sullivan and O’Keeffe looked at crime statistics for the duration of the slowdown, and they found something surprising: reports of major crime dropped during the slowdown period.Competing explanationsMaybe people didn’t bother calling the cops during the slowdown? That’s possibly the most obvious explanation. Perhaps public trust in police was damaged after this well-publicized incident of police violence. Or perhaps people knew about the slowdown and didn’t think there was any point in reporting crimes—although it’s difficult to believe that people were likely to let things like burglary slide.Regardless of possible motivations, the data suggests otherwise. The drop in major crime didn’t occur after the killing of Eric Garner, during the protests, or after the decision not to indict. In a similar seven-week window after the killing of Freddie Gray in April 2015, there was no comparable drop. So, public trust in police doesn’t seem to be the reason.The drop also lingered for the first few weeks after the slowdown and after public statements reporting that it was over. That also undermines the idea that people weren’t bothering to report crimes because they thought there was no point. It’s not possible to show conclusively that under-reporting doesn’t explain the pattern, but it doesn’t seem like a particularly good explanation.Another explanation could be that police violence serves as a ghoulish deterrent: that after a publicized incident of violence, people are less likely to engage in crime because they become more scared of the consequences. Again, the exact timing of the crime drop matches the slowdown rather than the incidents themselves, suggesting that this wasn’t the case.Proactive policing and its discontentsSullivan and O’Keeffe suggest that the absence of police activity itself is what led to the drop in crime. To explain this, they point to the idea of “proactive policing,” which suggests that police shouldn’t wait for crime to be reported but, rather, should be patrolling and maintaining order constantly through policing of low-level crimes, a strategy popularized as the “broken windows” model. The idea behind it is that aggressive, low-level policing, like stop-and-frisk and the issuing of citations, deters more serious crime.But the authors argue that the data suggests the opposite is true. “The results,” they write, “imply that aggressively enforcing minor legal statutes incites more severe criminal acts.” Rather than proactive policing deterring major crime, Sullivan and O’Keeffe think it’s more likely that this kind of aggressive enforcement “disrupts communal life, which can drain social control of group-level violence.” In other words, overly aggressive policing brings a level of social disruption that actually leads to more crime—and the reduced proactive policing during the slowdown produced a calming effect.There’s a lot to question here. As criminologist David Weisburd points out in a commentary in Nature News & Views, “proactive policing” can result in a huge array of different strategies, some of which have data indicating that they work. It’s difficult to take a finding from the exact strategy applied in New York, in a specific city in a very particular political climate, and generalize to other contexts. The natural experiment is “well-done social science, and, in this context, the results have strong weight,” Weisburd writes. But “we need experimental evidence,” he adds.And other questions arise, too, like whether seven weeks would have been long enough for things to change—if the problem with proactive policing is the kind of social stress that Sullivan and O’Keeffe point to, is seven weeks enough time for life to start knitting back together?The study is an important contribution to an ongoing question. Right now, some evidence points in favor of proactive policing, and some points against it. And the precise implementation of different proactive policing strategies will also need careful study. Given the monumental impact on many people’s lives, there’s an urgent need for more research to contribute to the pile of evidence.","NYC cops did a work stop, yet crime dropped",https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/09/nyc-cops-did-a-work-stop-yet-crime-dropped/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20419500792_1d2839bff1_k-760x380.jpg,technology,us,"The PC enthusiast's resource.

The new system currently supports machines with all-flash built-in storage, so those with Fusion Drives can't use it. However, a report from MacRumors cites an e-mail to a reader from Apple's Craig Federighi that states APFS will support Fusion Drives with later software updates. Apple confirmed to Ars that this is the case: support for Fusion systems will come in future updates.Further ReadingThose who tested the beta version of High Sierra were in a pickle before the official release of the update on September 25. Because APFS did not support Fusion Drive systems like older iMacs and Mac Minis at launch, those who had their file systems already converted to APFS needed to revert them back to the older HFS+ format. APFS support was included in early betas of High Sierra but was then removed in the most recent beta versions.Apple provided a long list of instructions on how to change back to the HFS+ format before High Sierra became available. Only those who downloaded beta versions of High Sierra had to worry about converting back before the official version was released. Now, with High Sierra available to all, those with Fusion Drives simply will not be updated to APFS until support for the new file system is released in later updates.APFS replaces the old-school HFS+ format that Apple has used for years. In macOS High Sierra, it updates systems with a more modern file system that includes support for solid-state drive optimization, built-in encryption, and general performance improvements.Valentina Palladino Valentina is the Associate Reviewer for Ars Technica, covering all gadgets with a focus on mobile devices and wearables.

In 2010, the Business Software Alliance estimated that generalized software piracy costs the world $51 billion annually and half a million jobs. Even most people who doubt every pirated download is equivalent to a lost sale will admit that illegal downloads have some negative effect on overall game sales.So it's more than a bit surprising that an exhaustive study of piracy's effects by the European Commission found that ""illegal consumption [of games] leads to increased legal consumption."" To be more precise, the study estimates that for every 100 games that are downloaded illegally, players actually legally obtain 24 more games (including free games) than they would in a world in which piracy didn't exist.The 306-page ""Estimating Displacement Rates of Copyrighted Content in the EU"" report (PDF) points out a number of caveats for this headline number, not least of which is a 45-percent error margin that makes the results less than statistically significant (i.e. indistinguishable from noise). That said, the same study finds that piracy has the more-expected negative effects on sales of films and books (and a neutral effect on music), singling out games as one area where piracy really does seem to work differently.""This positive effect of illegal downloads and streams on the sales of games may be explained by the industry being successful in converting illegal users to paying users,"" the study authors write. Increased game sales may come from piracy as ""players [get] hooked and then [pay] to play the game with extra bonuses or at extra levels,"" they continue. When it comes to games, ""only free games are more likely displaced by online copyright infringements than not,""—that is, people who pirate games seem to use them as replacements for other free gaming options more than for games they would otherwise buy.How do they know?The core of the study's findings come from surveys of 30,000 consumers in six EU countries (UK, Germany, France, Spain, Poland, and Sweden). Thus, it relies largely on self-reported data about game purchases and use of illegal download sites. But the study isn't so naive as to simply ask ""how many games do you pirate"" and ""would you buy more games if piracy wasn't an option"" and be done with it.On the contrary, the study authors take pains to use a number of survey strategies and statistical models to limit the effects of false and misremembered responses, as well as the ""endogeneity"" problem in the correlation (i.e. people who like games are more likely to play both pirated and legitimate games).For instance, the survey asks respondents about their generalized moral attitude toward piracy and their familiarity with piracy terms, both of which are highly correlated with reported piracy rates. As the study authors put it, ""if people know piracy terms but do not report piracy, this might indicate untruthful responses.""Respondents were also asked specific questions about their willingness to pay various prices for their last illegal download to try to transform hypothetical counterfactuals about a piracy-free world into specific questions about an actual game. Finally, econometric models were used to estimate piracy's effects based on piracy-correlated factors like the availability of high-speed Internet and the frequency people use the Internet to read about news or to do homework.While it may be truly impossible to know what a piracy-free world would look like, this is one of the more exhaustive and rigorous efforts we've seen to actually suss out whether and how much piracy displaces legitimate game sales. The counterintuitive finding that sales likely increase as piracy goes up should be taken with a grain of salt, but it can't be dismissed entirely.Kyle Orland Kyle is the Senior Gaming Editor at Ars Technica, specializing in video game hardware and software.

Soon, you might be able to add ""electric cars"" to that list. In an e-mail to his staff, James Dyson revealed that the company has started work on a battery electric vehicle. According to the message, the project is expected to cost at least $2.7 billion (£2 billion), and, if all goes to plan, the EV should be launched in 2020.The EV project is already 400-strong—that number includes some veterans of Aston Martin, Tesla, and BMW—and is ""recruiting aggressively."" As Autocar notes, last year Dyson received a $21.4 million (£16 million) grant from the UK government. That is part of an ongoing strategy to provide funding to many of the country's small-volume manufacturers and suppliers. Morgan, that most traditional of car makers, is one such recipient, as is another sports car outfit, Ariel.The BBC reports that half of the $2.7 billion investment will go toward developing the batteries for the EV, with the rest spent on the vehicle itself. Nor should we expect something cheap and cheerful, as Dyson is targeting the ""tech end"" of the market. According to Bloomberg, the car will use solid-state batteries, not lithium-ion. Recently, VW Group also committed to developing solid-state batteries for EVs.Dyson cites a desire to do something about air pollution as the impetus behind much of his company's work, and, much like Tesla's Elon Musk, decided to develop his own EV in response to a lack of action by traditional automakers. Building cars might at first seem a little out of the comfort zone for the company, but as the inventor points out, it does have a wealth of experience with electric motors and energy storage.

3936,4312,Edgar Alvarez,2017-09-26 19:00:00,The NBA's '2K' eSports league will have its first season next May.,none,2017-09-26T19:00:00Z,0.334034055076729,engadget,"The NBA’s big eSports push begins in May 2018The line between eSports and traditional sports is blurring, and organizations like the National Basketball Association are looking to stay ahead of the curve. Seventeen teams from the NBA will be part of the upcoming 2K League, a competition it created in partnership with Take-Two Interactive, the developer of the popular NBA 2K series. And that league is going to have its first season next May, NBA 2K League Managing Director Brendan Donohue revealed to Engadget in a recent interview.He also said that participating NBA teams will begin drafting their eSports players in mid-March 2018, with tryouts taking place a month before that. Once each franchise selects the five people who are going to represent it, they'll be official members of their respective organizations in April. Yes, that means they will get a proper contract and sponsorship deals, just as NBA players do.NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and Take-Two CEO Strauss ZelnickSince being announced in February, the NBA 2K League (initially known as the NBA 2K eLeague) has piqued the interest of both fans of professional gaming and conventional sports. That's mostly because this is the first league where eSports squads are owned by professional sports organization such as the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors, two of the teams that will play in the 2K League. Traditionally, ownership of eSports teams are by firms like Cloud9, which fields players Rocket League, League of Legends and Call of Duty and other gaming tournaments.Along with the Cavs and Warriors, the rest of the teams in the first season of the 2K League include the Boston Celtics, Dallas Mavericks, Detroit Pistons, Indiana Pacers, Memphis Grizzlies, Miami Heat, Milwaukee Bucks, New York Knicks, Orlando Magic, Philadelphia 76ers, Portland Trail Blazers, Sacramento Kings, Toronto Raptors, Utah Jazz and Washington Wizards.Donohue said that aside from these, there ""four or five"" others that have already reached out with interest in being part of the second year. There are 30 NBA teams total, and some of the notable absences from the 2K League include the Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers and San Antonio Spurs, three of the most decorated franchises in league history. ""We would expect to expand pretty quickly,"" he said.Until that happens, though, Donohue said the NBA is focused on ironing out a few more key details. For starters, the league and its partner, Take-Two Interactive, are still trying to determine how the tryout process will work and whether official games are going to be played on PC, PlayStation or Xbox. They've also yet to lock down where people will be able to watch the 2K League.Donohue said media rights are still being worked out, but the idea is to have studios on the East and West Coasts that broadcast or stream the games. It'll be interesting to see if the NBA strikes a deal with a platform like Twitch or one of the many TV networks trying to take eSports into the mainstream. ESPN, NBC and TBS could all make a move, though it's also worth keeping in mind that the NBA has its own TV network, NBA TV.One thing is certain: The NBA 2K League is taking shape rather quickly, especially when you consider that it was unveiled a few months ago.“Physical prowess, at least the way it's necessary on an NBA court, will no longer be necessary”NBA Commissioner Adam SilverNBA Commissioner Adam Silver said at the 2017 All-Star Weekend in New Orleans, ""Physical prowess, at least the way it's necessary on an NBA court, will no longer be necessary. It may be a different kind of physical prowess in terms of reflexes and your ability to move your thumbs very quickly, but these athletes can be any shape or size, and any age, and from anywhere."" Donohue echoed that statement, noting that it's in the NBA's DNA to make its properties inclusive and that's the intention with the 2K League as well.The main restriction is that gamers have to be at least 18 years old to compete, and that'll likely disappoint some of them. But Donohue said that male or female, the only thing that will matter come tryouts will be whether you're one of the best 85 NBA 2K18 players in the world. If you think you have what it takes, then you better pick up that controller and start practicing now. Who knows, maybe you can live your dream of being the next Michael Jordan -- even if you'll have an avatar on a digital court to thank for it.Edgar began hitting newsrooms as a young kid in the ’90s, when his dad worked at a regional newspaper.

It removed @replies from the limit earlier this year, and exempted photos, videos and quotes from it last year. Now, it's ready to push those character restrictions once again. The company announced today that it's going to experiment with expanding its 140-character limit to a whopping 280, at least to users whose language is anything other than Japanese, Chinese or Korean. The reason for doing so, according to Twitter, is that you can say much more in certain languages than others.In a blog post, Product Manager Aliza Rosen said that those who use certain East Asian languages on Twitter don't suffer the same restraints as English-speaking users. ""We see that a small percent of tweets sent in Japanese have 140 characters (only 0.4 percent). But in English, a much higher percentage of tweets have 140 characters (9 percent). Most Japanese tweets are 15 characters while most English tweets are 34."" This 140-character limit, she says, is a cause of frustration for English users, but not Japanese users, because of the difference in language.So in the interest of making it easier for everyone to use Twitter, the company is testing out the aforementioned 280-character limit to a small group of people. Again, this will only impact users whose language is not Japanese, Chinese or Korean. Rosen says in the blog post that it hopes to collect data and gather feedback about the test before it finally rolls out the 280-character limit on a wider scale.""We understand since many of you have been tweeting for years, there may be an emotional attachment to 140 characters -- we felt it, too,"" says Rosen in the blog post. ""But we tried this, saw the power of what it will do, and fell in love with this new, still brief, constraint.""280 characters is certainly a big leap from 140 -- it's twice the number, after all -- but it's much less than the 10,000 character limit that was rumored last year. By comparison, 280 doesn't seem that bad. It appears that, at least for now, the company is sticking to the Twitter-means-brevity script that has been with it from the very beginning.

Ivanka told reporters, ""Given the growing role of technology in American industry, it is vital our students become fluent in coding and computer science, with early exposure to both.""The money Trump has asked Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to use towards expanding computer science education isn't additional money for the department to use, but is rather a request to redirect current funds in a way that prioritizes STEM and computer science.

However, Intel is taking another tack as well with an experimental chip called ""Loihi."" Rather than relying on raw computing horsepower, it uses an old-school, as-yet-unproven type of ""nueromorphic"" tech that's modeled after the human brain.Intel has been exploring neuromorphic tech for awhile, and even designed a chip in 2012. Instead of logic gates, it uses ""spiking neurons"" as a fundamental computing unit. Those can pass along signals of varying strength, much like the neurons in our own brains. They can also fire when needed, rather than being controlled by a clock like a regular processor.Intel's Loihi chip has 1,024 artificial neurons, or 130,000 simulated neurons with 130 million possible synaptic connections. That's a bit more complex than, say, a lobster's brain, but a long ways from our 80 billion neurons.Human brains work by relaying information with pulses or spikes, strengthening frequent connections and storing the changes locally at synapse interconnections. As such, brain cells don't function alone, because the activity of one neuron directly affects others -- and groups of cells working in concert lead to learning and intelligence.By simulating this behavior with the Loihi chip, it can (in theory) speed up machine learning while reducing power requirements by up to 1,000 times. What's more, all the learning can be done on-chip, instead of requiring enormous datasets. If incorporated into a computer, such chips could also learn new things on their own, rather than remaining ignorant of tasks they hasn't been taught specifically.These types of chips would give us the sort of AI behavior we expect (and fear) -- namely, robots and other devices that can learn as they go. ""The test chip [has] enormous potential to improve automotive and industrial applications as well as personal robots,"" Intel says.That all sounds good, but so far, neuromorphic chips have yet to prove themselves next to current, brute-force deep-learning technology. IBM has also developed a neuromorphic chip called ""TrueNorth,"" for instance, with 4096 processors that simulate around 256 million synapses. However, Facebook's deep learning specialist Yann LeCun said that chip wouldn't easily be able to do tasks like image recognition using the NeuFlow convolution model he designed.Intel has also admitted that its neuromorphic chip wouldn't do well with some types of deep-learning models. Via its acquisition of Movidius and MobilEye, however, it's already got a line of machine vision and learning chips that do work with current AI algorithms. It also acquired a company called Nervana last year to take on AI cloud processing leader NVIDIA.For Loihi, it plans to give the chips to select ""leading university and research institutions"" focused on artificial intelligence in the first half of 2018.

Vacuum cleaner and hairdryer producer Dyson announced today that it has already begun working on its own EV and that it should be ready for launch by 2020.In a letter to employees, company founder James Dyson said today that this has been a dream of his for some time and rumors have circulated in the past about the company heading in this direction. The path toward an fully-fledged EV began with an exhaust capture system aimed at reducing auto emissions. ""To our chagrin, nobody at the time was interested in employing our diesel exhaust capture system and we stopped the project,"" said Dyson, ""At this moment, we finally have the opportunity to bring all our technologies together into a single product. Rather than filtering emissions at the exhaust pipe, today we have the ability to solve it at the source. So I wanted you to hear it directly from me: Dyson has begun work on a battery electric vehicle, due to be launched by 2020.""So far, the company has recruited 400 people to work on the project, including Dyson and auto industry engineers and Dyson has pledged to put over $2.6 billion towards the project -- half toward the car itself and half toward the solid state battery technology.There aren't any details about the car just yet -- the company is keeping those under wraps for now. ""The project will grow quickly from here but at this stage we will not release any information. Competition for new technology in the automotive industry is fierce and we must do everything we can to keep the specifics of our vehicle confidential,"" said Dyson. And the Telegraph reports that whatever Dyson ends up producing will stand out from other EVs on the market, quoting Dyson as saying, ""There's no point in doing one that's like everybody else's. You'll have to wait and see, we're trying to be radical.""",Dyson plans to release its own EV by 2020,https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/26/dyson-release-own-ev-by-2020/,https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630&quality=80&image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F4b95529b25cc3063867330be5f353819%2F205707179%2FJames%2BDyson%2B-%2BHeathcliff%2BO%2BMalley%2B4.jpg&client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&signature=de464ec1607a537c250ddbc09a178db68b53c1aa,technology,us,Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics.,en,Engadget,['top'],https://www.engadget.com,"{'large': '', 'small': '', 'medium': ''}",16:50:00,2017,2017-09-27 00:00:00,2017-09-25 00:00:00,2017-09-01 00:00:00,2017-07-01 00:00:00

The reason: despite hundreds of millions of dollars poured into one of Roivant’s publicly traded subsidiaries — Axovant Sciences — the company just received news that its much-hyped, experimental Alzheimer’s drug, interperdine, doesn’t work.It’s a devastating outcome for Axovant, which was taken public in 2015 in what was then the biggest biotech IPO ever in the U.S., and whose shares have plummeted nearly 75 percent today on the news.The outcome is also a black mark against Roivant, which focuses on developing and commercializing a wide range of therapies and has numerous other subsidiaries, all of which involve the word “vant.”In addition to Axovant, which is focused on neurology, Roivant has spun out Myovant Sciences, which is focused on women’s health and endocrine diseases; Dermavant Sciences, which is focused on dermatology; Enzyvant Sciences, which is focused on rare diseases; Urovant Sciences, focused on urology; and, most newly, Datavant, an AI-driven initiative that’s aiming to improve the design of clinical trials.SoftBank’s investment is in Roivant only — not its subsidiaries. Founders Fund had also participated in that $1.1 billion round.Roivant still has plenty up its sleeve, notes founder and CEO Vivek Ramaswamy, a biology major at Harvard who worked a hedge fund analyst while earning a law degree from Yale — a job that served as the inspiration for Roivant.To wit, Ramaswamy has said he noticed pharmaceutical firms abandoning promising drugs for various reasons having nothing to do with their efficacy. Seeing an opportunity to complete the development of some of these overlooked drug candidates and get them to market quickly, and backed by the hedge fund where he’d been working, he struck out on his own in 2014.One of his first moves was to acquire an Alzheimer’s pill from GlaxoSmithKline as it was dialing down its neuroscience research, forming Axovant around it and naming it interperdine. Based on promising early results, Roivant took the company public. With those tests ongoing, Roivant also took public Myovant Sciences. It, too, was the biggest biotech IPO of the year. The drug candidate around which Myovant is centered is called relugolix; it aims to treat endometriosis and uterine fibroids and reportedly aced a mid-stage trial that ended in the spring.Altogether, says Ramaswamy, Roivant’s companies are working on 16 different drug candidates in varying stages of development. That includes Axovant, which apart from interperdine has a drug in Phase II trials right now for a progressive brain disorder called Lewy body dementia. Actor Robin Williams struggled with the disease, which impacts roughly 1.3 million Americans. (By way of comparison, an estimated 5.5 million Americans of all ages have Alzheimer’s disease.)Ramaswamy has always acknowledged that the odds of coming up with an Alzheimer’s cure remain dauntingly low. At a small event hosted by this editor back in February, he described it as among the “riskiest areas of drug development,” but said it was worth the gamble, calling Alzheimer’s “probably the single greatest health threat to the economic security of our country over the next 40 years.” Left unchecked, he’d continued, “It’s probably the one disease area that we can definitely say has the potential to bankrupt our system.”Today, Ramaswamy called Axovant’s results “disappointing for our company but also for a therapeutics area that really needed a win. We were hopeful we could take a shot at bucking that trend and I’m sorry for the millions of people and their caregivers who need new options. I’m sorry we couldn’t deliver that.”He observed that David Hung, whom Ramaswamy recruited to lead Axovant, joined the company as CEO from Medivation, a biopharmaceutical company that saw its own hopes to cure Alzheimer’s dashed in 2010 when a drug it had concocted failed in its first late-stage clinical trial.It’s worth noting that with its back against the wall, Medivation went on to create a blockbuster prostate cancer drug, and last year, Pfizer acquired the company for $14 billion.The same could prove true for Roivant, but the company has a much taller wall to climb now, particularly given its splashy debut and the attention paid to Axovant in particular as its first spin-out. As Harvard business professor and Axovant board member Gary Pisano told the outlet STAT last year, “In biotech, your first impression is your first drug.”SoftBank declined comment for this story, though a person familiar with the team’s thinking says that SoftBank’s interest in Roivant was never “premised on Axovant’s success” and that it is instead a “broader and longer-term thesis” based on Roivant’s ability to leverage data sets and artificial intelligence to ultimately create FDA-approved drugs.Certainly, Softbank’s team couldn’t have anticipated today’s outcome when it invested in Roivant last month. Trials are completely “blinded” until they are ended.In fact, as some readers might recall, billionaire hedge fund manager Steve Cohen bet a quarter of a billion dollars on what seemed like another promising Alzheimer’s drug in 2008 and was charged with insider trading when it was learned that one of his portfolio managers was secretly obtaining details about the progress of its clinical trials.Cohen’s hedge fund had dumped all of its shares by the time the disappointing results were made public. He later paid out a $1.8 billion fine to the SEC to settle the case.",Roivant receives bad news — and so does SoftBank,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/roivant-receives-bad-news-and-so-does-softbank/,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/screen-shot-2017-09-26-at-12-41-46-pm.png,technology,us,"TechCrunch is a leading technology media property, dedicated to obsessively profiling startups, reviewing new Internet products, and breaking tech news.",en,TechCrunch,['top'],https://techcrunch.com,"{'large': '', 'small': '', 'medium': ''}",19:57:03,2017,2017-09-27 00:00:00,2017-09-25 00:00:00,2017-09-01 00:00:00,2017-07-01 00:00:00

The two companies had clearly come to an agreement that benefitted their mutual interests – for Amazon, that meant getting its streaming video app onto Apple TV devices; and for Apple, it meant getting its streaming media player on Amazon.com’s retail site again.Amazon a couple of years ago had stopped selling the Apple TV, as well as Google Chromecast, even extending that ban to third-party sellers. The company had said at the time that it wouldn’t sell media players that didn’t support its Amazon Prime Video application, in order to avoid customer confusion.But ahead of Apple’s WWDC event this summer, Recode reported that Amazon and Apple were nearing an agreement to bring Amazon’s app to Apple TV. BuzzFeed later confirmed the news, ahead of Cook’s announcement.The product listing for the Apple TV on Amazon was first spotted by 9to5Mac, which noted the 64 GB Apple TV 4K ($199) was added to Amazon’s site in the last couple of days. It’s also not a third-party listing, and can be added to shoppers’ carts now even if it’s “out of stock.” (Appleinsider also found a 32 GB model available, but said it appeared to be from a gray-market seller.)The re-emergence of the Apple TV also hints that the Amazon Prime Video app will soon be appearing in the Apple TV App Store, as previously planned. But although the newest version of the Apple TV has gone on sale, the Amazon Prime Video app is still ‘coming soon.’",The Apple TV is back on Amazon,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/the-apple-tv-is-back-on-amazon/,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/4k_screen_and_appletv.jpg,technology,us,"TechCrunch is a leading technology media property, dedicated to obsessively profiling startups, reviewing new Internet products, and breaking tech news.",en,TechCrunch,['top'],https://techcrunch.com,"{'large': '', 'small': '', 'medium': ''}",18:39:10,2017,2017-09-27 00:00:00,2017-09-25 00:00:00,2017-09-01 00:00:00,2017-07-01 00:00:00

Your favorite spreadsheet is about to get a lot smarter, thanks to the help of machine learning and a better connection to the outside world.As Jared Spataro, Microsoft’s general manager for Office, and Rob Howard, the company’s director of Office 365 ecosystem marketing, showed me during a briefing at the company’s Ignite conference today, Excel will soon be able to understand more about your inputs and then pull additional information from the internet as necessary.“We’re pleased to introduce new data types,” Spataro explained. “That doesn’t sound all that interesting and we had this interesting discussion about what we’d name these things, but at the end of the day we realized that if you’re really an Excel wonk, the thing that you’re going to get is that there’s new data types.”This isn’t just a feature for Excel wonks, though. In today’s demo, Spataro showed me how you will soon be able to tag a list of company names as — well — company names, for example. Once you’ve done that, Excel can pull in more information about the company from Microsoft’s Bing API, including stock data and market cap, for example. Excel can even automatically detect that a list of names is indeed a list of company names or a list of cities, for example, which then allows you to pull in population data, among other things.“Historically, Excel has always been good at numbers and you can enter in text and use conditional formatting and things like that,” Spataro said. “We are adding the idea that Excel can now recognize data types that are richer than those two.”In addition, the Office team is also launching a new built-in tool for Excel that will automatically try to pull the most interesting data from a spreadsheet and visualize it. “Insights,” as the company is currently calling it, is modeled on a very similar feature in the Power BI data visualization and analysis tool, and it’s worth noting that Google Sheets also offers a comparable tool. “It is meant to take any list of data and then start to generate insights,” Spataro said. “It will look at combinations, charts, pivot tables and it will recognize those that are most interesting by looking at outliers, looking at trends in the data, looking at things that represent changes.” If you like one of the graphs the service generates, you can easily import those into your Excel sheets and manipulate them to your heart’s content.As Microsoft also announced earlier this week, Excel will soon be able to pull in machine learning models that a company’s data scientists have created to analyze information in Excel, and you can also now use JavaScript to write more complex scripts for manipulating data or pulling in data from virtually any third-party service with an API.The new data types will launch early next year. Insights will arrive in a spreadsheet near you in early 2018.As Spataro also noted, these kind of connections to third-party service are what differentiates Office 365 from the perpetual versions of Office. “Services breathe new life into these applications,” he said. “We think these apps still have a lot of life in them for just working on your content, but we do believe that these connections just makes it magical.”If you do want a perpetual license for Office, though, and not pay a subscription fee, you are in luck, because as the company also announced today, the next perpetual version of Office will launch in the second half of 2018, and, because that’s almost 2019, it will be called Office 2019.“Cloud-powered innovation is a major theme at Ignite this week. But we recognize that moving to the cloud is a journey with many considerations along the way,” Spataro writes in today’s announcement. “Office 2019 will be a valuable upgrade for customers who feel that they need to keep some or all of their apps and servers on-premises, and we look forward to sharing more details about the release in the coming months.”",Microsoft Excel is about to get a lot smarter,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/microsoft-excel-is-about-to-get-a-lot-smarter/,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_20170926_095637.jpg,technology,us,"TechCrunch is a leading technology media property, dedicated to obsessively profiling startups, reviewing new Internet products, and breaking tech news.",en,TechCrunch,['top'],https://techcrunch.com,"{'large': '', 'small': '', 'medium': ''}",15:31:30,2017,2017-09-27 00:00:00,2017-09-25 00:00:00,2017-09-01 00:00:00,2017-07-01 00:00:00

Things can go wrong during major software updates, and having a recent backup available can save you from a massive headache if anything bad happens.Do you have a specific iOS 11 problem not listed?Follow and tweet at us and we'll list it here and direct message you if we find a solution.1. Can’t connect to a Wi-Fi networkOne user has reported that their iPhone no longer allows them to join their personal Wi-Fi network, and they probably won’t be alone in this. Some preliminary steps to try resolving this issue would be to reset your phone, reset the Wi-Fi router (even if other devices are clearly connected to the internet through it) or forget the Wi-Fi network on your device and rejoin. You can also attempt to reset the network settings of your device by going to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings – don’t worry, this fix shouldn’t erase anything on your phone. However, the user who posted this issue tried many of these fixes to no success, so it may be a case of reverting back to iOS 10 and waiting for a fix to come from Apple.2. Some apps are gone or not working properlyIf you’ve been dragging along some old apps from phone to phone for a while now without updating them (either because you don’t update them or because the creator won’t update them) they may not work well with iOS 11. If they’re old enough, or still 32-Bit, they won’t be compatible with iOS 11.3. Your Phone’s is suddenly filling up its storageOne user has reported that the update to iOS 11 began to slowly increase the system storage on their device until the device was almost full. This error doesn’t appear to be linked to specific apps, but rather just the storage that the system itself takes up. This is an issue that has cropped up even in the Beta for iOS 11, Unfortunately, there’s no clear resolution for this issue at present, and you may want to revert to your backup and wait for iOS 11.1 if you experience this issue.4. The Home button is slow to wake up the deviceMultiple Apple users have posted that, after updating their old iPhones to iOS 11, their lock screen freezes for around 10 seconds, appearing to stall out or slowly load up before letting them use their device. Nothing could be more tedious than waiting around for 10 seconds just to check a notifications now and then. This is the type of problem that may resolve itself over time, as the new operating system gets familiar with your device and files. But if it persists more than a week, it will likely be worth restoring a backup of your phone and waiting for Apple to issue a fix for this.5. Poor battery life with iOS 11It seems that every new version of iOS invariably comes with a whole host of complaints that older iPhones have their battery life severely impacted. If your battery is dying early and it’s not simply because you’re spending more time playing with all the new features and learning all the new iOS 11 tricks, there are a lot of things that could be at the root of it.Older apps may not be playing nice with iOS 11. You can check to see if that’s the case by going into Settings > Battery and seeing which apps are using the most battery. If any apps that you hardly use are draining it like crazy, you might want to disable them until they get more iOS 11-friendly updates.It may also just be that it takes a little time for iOS 11 to get comfy with your device. This process could take a few days, so you might want to just wait it out. In the meantime, you can turn off GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth when you’re not using them. You should also lower the brightness of your screen and disable apps refreshing in the background (Settings > General > Background App Refresh).6. Your device is overheatingThere are plenty of reasons a phone can overheat, and complaints seem to crop up around new software updates. Maybe it’s iOS 11’s fault, maybe it just that your phone is working hard. In any case, you can temporarily address the overheating by turning the phone off, keeping it out of the sunlight or other heat sources (like the top of your computer) and exposing as much surface area as possible to the air (which means taking it out of any case and potentially propping it up. It’s worth noting that charging your device won’t help cool it down any, so wait until it’s cool to plug it back in.If your habits haven’t changed and your device is continuously overheating when it didn’t usually before, it may be time for you to consider restoring an earlier backup of your device. A short battery life may be annoying, but overheating can seriously damage your device, and iTunes won’t restore a fried CPU.7. Power button isn’t workingIf something goes wrong with the update and your power button stops working, you can shut your device down in the menus. To do this, go to Setting>General, and scroll all the way to the bottom of the list, where you’ll see a “Shut down” option that will give you a slider on screen to turn your device off. This is especially handy if you are trying to restart or power down the phone because something else is going wrong, such as overheating.8. iOS 11 won’t let you seen email with Outlook/ExchangeApple has acknowledged a bug that’s preventing some iOS 11 users from sending emails through certain Microsoft-run servers. The error message says “Cannot Send Mail. The message was rejected by the server.” Unfortunately, if this is the case for you, you may have to wait until Apple and Microsoft sort out the issue and use a different device to send those emails.9. Control center isn’t how you want it, lacks features you want, or has features you don’t wantControl Center is Apple’s handy new way of controlling many aspects of your device, whether that disconnecting from Wi-Fi or quickly switching songs. You may have heard all abut what Control Center can do only to find that it doesn’t have all those features right there and ready for you when you install iOS 11. Or it it may seem cluttered with tools you don’t think you’ll ever use. Luckily this is an easy fix, as you can customize the iOS 11 Control Center by going to Settings > Control Center > Customize Controls.10. Control Center keeps on popping up while playing gamesAs handy as Control Center is intended to be, Apple made sure you could easily access it simply by swiping up from the bottom of your device’s screen. Unfortunately, this can mean you accidentally swipe it onto the screen when you’re in the middle of using an app or playing a game. You can disable this access method while in other apps by going to Settings > Control Center and disable the ability to access it within apps.11. Control Center isn’t actually turning off Wi-Fi or BluetoothIf you’re running into battery-life issues, like to stretch your battery life as much as possible or simply want to avoid risky wireless connection situations, you might want to turn Wi-Fi and Bluetooth off when you’re not using either. You’ll probably pop open the Control Center and toggle both off, except it just so happens those controls won’t actually turn either off. They may disconnect you from the networks or devices you’re currently connected to, but they’ll leave the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios on. If you want to turn both off, you’ll have to go into the main settings menu to do so, or you can use Airplane Mode to shut off all the device’s radios.12. The new Dock at the bottom of your iPad keeps disappearingIf you just got iOS 11 on your iPad, you might be loving the new Dock at the bottom of your screen that keep your favorite apps and tools handy. It’s just like the Dock in Mac OS. However, you may find it occasionally or frequently disappearing on you. Don’t worry. It’s supposed to do that. To bring it back, all you have to do is swipe up at the bottom of the screen where it hides when not in use.13. It’s going crazy with your image formatsiOS 11 signals Apple’s commitment to a newer image format: HEIC. This new file type compresses images more than JPEG, so your images won’t take up as much space on your device. But not every device out there supports HEIC, and Apple knows this. To make it easier for Apple users to share their photos with others, iOS may convert them to JPEG when they’re sent, or even if they’re being uploaded online. If this frequent file-type swapping is a nuisance, you can disable it by either stopping the conversion from HEIC to JPEG, or by having your device take photos as JPEG files instead.14. Messages not backing up to iCloud and deletes not syncingIf you’ve been looking out for all the cool new features coming with iOS 11, you probably noticed that Apple planned to make it very easy to backup Messages in iCloud. Messages would even be synced across devices, so you wouldn’t have to delete a conversation thread on every single one of your Apple devices.Unfortunately, if you’re having trouble finding that features, it’s because it’s not there yet. Apple has this feature planned for iOS 11, but it will be coming in a later iteration of the operating system.15. Can’t make Apple Pay payments to friendsThis is another case of an iOS 11 feature that isn’t coming with the operating system at launch. If you’re trying to make direct payments to friend using Apple Pay, you’re going to be disappointed. While you can currently use a load of other apps to accomplish this, you’ll have to wait for a future update of iOS 11 before the feature is available through Apple Pay.16. Can’t use AnimojiUnfortunately, no one can use Animoji right now. There’s no fix for this at the moment. The new animated emoji that allow you to have an emoji mimic the movements and expressions of your face relies on Apple’s facial recognition technology, and that’s only available on the iPhone X. If you desperately want to use Animoji, the only fix is to get an iPhone X, but it’s not available until November.17. Siri sounds differentiOS 11 has come along with updates to the way Siri speaks, making her sound more natural and less robotish. This will hopefully be nothing but an improvement, and if you don’t like it, there’s not much you can do besides sticking with the old iOS. On the other hand, if Siri now has a man’s voice, it may be that you didn’t realize this has been an option in iOS for some time. If someone else was playing around in your phone and switch Siri’s voice, you should easily be able to go back into your device’s settings and set Siri to have whichever voice you were using before (or perhaps try out some new ones).18. Someone is taking pictures of you during FaceTime callsThis problem may be a bit of an outlier, but iOS 11 gives users the option to allow special screenshots within FaceTime calls called “FaceTime Live Photos.” These photos are clear images of the person on the other end without the on-screen interface. If someone you regularly FaceTime is being a pest and taking loads of these Live Photos of you, you can disallow the feature by going to Settings > FaceTime and disabling FaceTime Live Photos. The other person will still be able to take normal screenshots though.19. You can’t get iOS 11While iOS 11 is available for a lot of devices, Apple hasn’t made the brand new operating system available for all of its past iPhones and iPads. You can check for all the specific iOS 11 compatibility list, but the simple answer is that you need a device at least as new as the iPhone 6 or iPhone SE, the 6th-gen iPod touch, an iPad Pro, an iPad Mini 2, or an iPad Air. Older Apple devices are not supported for iOS 11, so the only fix here is to grab a new one.We can help you find a great iPhone deal if you want to upgrade to the latest phone and operating system without paying full price for every part of it.20. The update just doesn’t startIf you have a device compatible with iOS 11 but for some reason can’t get the new operating system to download, there are a few possible explanations. If you don’t have space for the new OS to download onto your phone, you may need to free up a couple gigabytes of space on your phone before you can download and start the update. You can also plug your phone into your computer, and download and install the iOS 11 update through iTunes.Your phone may just not be responding to your command to download iOS 11 and install it. If that’s the case, you can restart the phone or try force closing the Settings app. To do this, go to the app switching screen on your iPhone or iPad, find the settings app, and swipe up.21. The update did not go as plannedIf you’ve updated your iPhone or iPad to iOS 11 and anything seems to have gone wrong, there’s an easy fix. If you’re just unpleased with the way the update looks and feels, or it’s overheating your phone and draining your battery like mad or is just generally not pleasing in some way, you can just restore your device with the backup you (hopefully) created. We have a guide for you on both how to backup and restore your iPhone or iPad.22. Your phone won’t start at all after the updateIn a worst case scenario, an error while your phone or tablet is updating to iOS 11 could effectively brick it, meaning it won’t start up. Fewer things more frightening can happen to a device packed with photos and videos and memories. But, if you’ve been listening carefully, you’ve already made a backup of your phone. You should be able to use this to restore your phone to its state before you tried installing the update, or whichever start it was in when you created the backup.",iOS 11 problems: how to fix them,http://www.techradar.com/how-to/ios-11-problems-how-to-fix-them,http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/323a28bc8e236c28786cc8488a09c0a6-1200-80.jpg,technology,us,"The latest technology news and reviews, covering computing, home entertainment systems, gadgets and more.",en,TechRadar,['top'],http://www.techradar.com,"{'large': '', 'small': '', 'medium': ''}",19:52:12,2017,2017-09-22 00:00:00,2017-09-18 00:00:00,2017-09-01 00:00:00,2017-07-01 00:00:00
4099,4569,John McCann,2017-09-21 09:40:50,"More pixels, for a start",none,2017-09-21T09:40:50.,0.7828530645017396,techradar,"More pixels, for a startUpdate:Google has just bought part of HTC's smartphone business and in the process revealed that many HTC employees were already working on Pixel phones, suggesting HTC is behind the Pixel 2.And a new batch of leaks claims to show off the final design of the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, including the colors and storage configurations that will be available, as well as how much each will cost you.The next flagship phone(s) from Google look to be less than a month away, and rumors surrounding the Google Pixel 2 and Google Pixel 2 XL are starting to intensify as we approach the launch.The search giant is done with the Nexus line and in its place the firm has created a slightly more premium, and far more mainstream range of devices.That could mean that the Pixel 3 onwards will be in-house phones, but for now all eyes are on the Pixel 2, and rumors are promising. You can read them all below, followed by a wish list of the things we want from the Pixel 2.Cut to the chaseWhat will it cost? Rumored to start at $649 (£599, AU$1,079), working up to $949Google Pixel 2 release date and priceKey points:Google Pixel 2 launch date: October 4Google Pixel 2 price: expect a flagship tagThe Google Pixel and Pixel XL were both launched in October 2016, and it looks like it'll be the same again this year as the Google Pixel 2 launch event is set for October 4.Google has sent out invites to an event on October 4 which will kick off at 9am PST (San Francisco), 12pm EST (New York), 5pm BST.Google is yet to officially confirm the Google Pixel 2 release date, but we expect the phone to go on sale by the end of October.According to one source the Google Pixel 2 will apparently carry a loftier price tag than its predecessors - something we hope doesn't turn out to be true.The old one started at $649 (£599, AU$1,079), or $769 (£719, AU$1,269) for the XL version, so it was already expensive.We've recently heard that the Pixel 2 will start at the same $649 price point, but it will reportedly cost $200 to make the jump up to the Pixel 2 XL, which is said to start at $849 (about £630, AU$1079).TechRadar's take: The Pixel 2 will launch on October 4, and we reckon the on sale date will be in the same month, but it's unlikely to be cheaper than the original Pixel.While you wait for the Google Pixel 2 launch, check out our video review of the original Google Pixel below:How many Google Pixel 2 phones?Key points:Most likely two, but some suggestions of threeThe latest rumors suggest we'll get two rather than three new Pixel phones from Google, as apparently the Pixel 2 XL has been cancelled.Instead we're in line for the larger taimen (codename) handset, and this could be very, very big - up to 5.99 inches in screen size if the latest leaks are to be believed.It's thought to be a similar vein to the Motorola Nexus 6 from 2014. Motorola told TechRadar last year it thought the Nexus 6 was too big when it made the phone, but Google wanted the larger screen on the phone so the company made it for the Nexus project.We expect this will be a similar situation where Google again wanted a bigger product, and given that other handsets are growing in size it's not surprising.There has also been rumors suggesting we may get three new Pixel phones , as we've heard word of handsets codenamed 'walleye' and 'muskie' - believed to be the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL respectively, along with 'taimen'. But, as mentioned above, the muskie may have been cancelled.Google Pixel 2 screenHottest leaks:A curved screenA 5.6-inch 18:9 displayA 2,560 x 1,312 resolutionOne rumor for the Google Pixel 2 is that the phone may come with a curved display when it launches later this year.Google has tried to put an order for curved OLED screens with the LG Display Company, which suggests the company is ready to embrace curved screens on the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. Not just that, a recent rumor states that LG itself might actually be making one of the phones.Based on benchmarks that have appeared on the web, one of the Pixel 2 phones could come with a 5.6-inch 18:9 screen and a 2,560 x 1,312 resolution.However, another source claims that the standard Pixel 2 will have a 4.97-inch screen, while a larger model will land with a 5.99-inch one.While another source says the Pixel 2 XL will have a 6-inch AMOLED screen, supplied by LG.Elsewhere, we've heard that this screen might have an always-on function, so you can see the time and notifications at a glance, and that it will have customizable settings, including a new 'Vivid Colors' mode.Those features combined with the use of AMOLED would give it a lot in common with the Samsung Galaxy S8.TechRadar's take: QHD or above resolutions on all models are likely, to bring them in line with rivals. The screens may also grow.Google Pixel 2 designHottest leaks:Rear-facing fingerprint scannerWater resistanceTiny bezels on the Pixel 2 XLMay lack a 3.5mm headphone jackOur first look at the purported Pixel 2 XL showed a design very similar to that of the Pixel XL, complete with a metal and glass back, but the glass window this time appears smaller and the fingerprint scanner is in the metal part. It also has far smaller bezels than its predecessor.Interestingly, the latest leak contradicts ones that we've seen previously in one key way: the bezels on the front of the Pixel 2 may not end up being any thinner than what's seen on today's Google Pixel device.Credit: VentureBeatWe don't know much about the design of the standard Pixel 2 yet, although we have seen leaked cases supposedly designed for the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL.They're similar in a lot of ways, showing off a rear-facing fingerprint scanner on both, along with a 3.5mm headphone port (which we'd previously heard might be ditched).Image 1 of 6Credit: SlashleaksImage 2 of 6Image 3 of 6Image 4 of 6Image 5 of 6Image 6 of 6The case images include an insert seemingly showing the designs of the phones, and while the one for the Pixel 2 looks similar to the original Pixel, with slim side bezels but big ones above and below the screen, the Pixel 2 XL case insert shows and almost bezel-free design - though these could just be placeholders rather than accurate designs. Or they could be proof that the above image is speaking some truth.It's also rumored that the Pixel 2 will come with a waterproof design. A Senior Editor at 9to5Google reported a source has said the phone will be dunkable when it's released.We've seen newer renders that claim to show off the final design of the Pixel 2 family of phones. Much of it falls in line with what we've seen previously, but the most noteworthy change is the lack of 3.5mm headphone jack.The latest bit of leaks surrounding the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL talk of its colors. As you might remember, the original Pixel and Pixel XL were available in white, black, and blue variants. The black and the white options definitely still look to be available, but for the smaller of the two Pixels, a new option called ""Kinda Blue"" will round out the color offering.For the Pixel 2 XL, that phone is said to come in white or black, but the white option has a black top and interestingly, an orange power button, both of which give it a bit of extra flair.TechRadar's take: A similar but refined design with added water resistance is likely. Plus the 3.5mm headphone jack is likely to go so Google can make the phone thinner.Elsewhere, we've seen images of Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL cases (pictured above), which show different camera cut-outs on the two phones, so they might not both have the same camera.A benchmark for one of the models lists a 12MP rear camera with 4K video support, and a 7MP front-facing one. That sounds like a similar setup to the 12.3MP and 8MP combo on the original Google Pixel.While this doesn't add to the potential spec of the Pixel 2 camera, we've seen what appears to the be the much bigger sensor in a recent leak. It's about the size in diameter to the fingerprint sensor, so expect its low-light chops to be even more improved.We haven't heard any news on the battery yet, but the Pixel 2's is likely to be at least as big as the 2,770mAh one in the Pixel and the Pixel 2 XL's will probably at least match the 3,450mAh one in the Pixel XL.TechRadar's take: Camera and battery are anyone's guess right now, but expect improvements to both.This rumor has since been refuted by a Google exec, so it's looking unlikely - though the exec refers specifically to Pixel, so it's always possible that a budget Google handset will land without Pixel branding.We've also heard that a true phablet might be landing, alongside the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, so we could see at least three Pixel handsets this year.That phablet may have been benchmarked, as a phone going by 'Google taimen' has appeared on Geekbench with a 1.9GHz (likely Snapdragon 835) chipset, 4GB of RAM and strong benchmark scores.Regarding storage, the Pixel 2's FCC filing surfaced and seems to have confirmed that the phone might start with 64GB of storage and work up from there.Those specs are in line with other recent flagships, so they're believable, especially as the Snapdragon 835 has been rumored for all three Pixel 2 handsets/Very similar benchmark specs have appeared on the web more recently, and been rumored elsewhere, so it looks as though the internals of the Pixel 2 phones are coming into focus.The benchmark also highlights its use of Android Oreo, which we're fully expecting to see on the phone, and some of these sources also point to 128GB of storage being included.TechRadar's take: A Snapdragon 835 chipset and 4GB of RAM are looking likely, while Android Oreo is a given.More evidence for the feature has appeared in a teardown of the latest Google app beta, which found the phrase “To change settings for the squeeze gesture, go to your phone’s Active Edge settings”, along with “Squeeze for your Assistant”, suggesting you can squeeze the sides to launch Google Assistant.Previously, we had heard from two different sources that the Pixel 2 XL might have squeezable sides, a lot like the HTC U11. These would apparently allow you to launch Google Assistant whether the screen is on or off, and could also be used for other things, such as silencing calls.There's no news on whether the standard Pixel 2 will have the same feature, but it's likely.The presence of such a feature also strongly suggests that HTC could be building the phones, though that's now been all but confirmed by Google's purchase of part of HTC.","Google Pixel 2 release date, news and rumors",http://www.techradar.com/news/google-pixel-2,http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7HACoVFdFefhPe7xnJXJWY-1200-80.jpg,technology,us,"The latest technology news and reviews, covering computing, home entertainment systems, gadgets and more.",en,TechRadar,['top'],http://www.techradar.com,"{'large': '', 'small': '', 'medium': ''}",09:40:50,2017,2017-09-22 00:00:00,2017-09-18 00:00:00,2017-09-01 00:00:00,2017-07-01 00:00:00

There’s an app for thatSharesApple doesn’t make many Android apps. In fact, it only makes three, and two of them are music apps. But it’s the third that’s the most interesting, because Move to iOS is designed to make swapping Android for iOS as easy as possible.Apple’s app was introduced in iOS 9, and it’s available for iPhones running that OS or later. It supports iPhones from the iPhone 5 onwards, iPads from the fourth generation, iPad minis from the second generation and the sixth generation iPod touch. On Android you’ll need to be running version 4.0 of Android or later.First things firstDon’t set up your iPhone or other iOS device until you’ve installed the Move to iOS app: it expects to see a factory-fresh (or at least, factory reset) device and it’s a pain to sort out on a phone or tablet that’s already been set up.Make sure both iOS and Android devices are plugged in, make sure your Android device is connected to Wi-Fi and make sure your iOS device has enough space: unlike many Android devices, which support extra storage via microSD cards, iOS devices’ storage is fixed.TechRadar's handy hint: Before transfer, clean your Android phone as much as possible. Delete any unwanted apps, photos and media - this is your chance for a 'smartphone spring clean' and you'll be surprised how many apps you rarely use when you think about it.1.

Even with the Intel Pentium processor and 4GB of RAM to start, this laptop will whip through pretty much any day-to-day activity you can throw at it without the juddering performance of even cheaper laptops.

Replete with an all-metal frame, this is probably one of the best-looking laptops for under 500 bucks. There are plenty of ports (old and new), 4GB of RAM and up to 512GB in solid-state storage. The cheapest models have a respectable Intel Core i3 processor, but you can get the more powerful i5 versions if you need that extra kick. Another dig at Apple? Unlike the Air, this laptop sports a fully HD screen.The best deals on our favorite laptopsWe've reviewed loads of laptops over the years: we've seen the good ones, the great ones and the ones to avoid. Sometimes, the best laptops pop up online at some truly deal-tastic prices. In this section, we list the very best laptops out there and the best deals on each one.The Dell XPS 13 is, bar none, the best laptop you can buy today. It features a revolutionary design that's astonishingly thin and light. Fitting a 13.3-inch screen into such a small frame means Dell has created a nearly borderless Infinity display. It's a powerful and long lasting machine even by today's Ultrabook standards. The XPS 13 comes outfitted with Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors plus lighting, quick storage and memory, all while coming in at a very affordable starting price. For these reasons, it easily takes the top slot as the best Ultrabook and the best overall laptop.The Asus ZenBook UX310, the long awaited follow-up to the ZenBook UX305, sports a 7th-generation Intel Kaby Lake processor and an all-aluminum frame, truly a candidate for the MacBook Air’s throne. That’s thanks in no small part to the ZenBook UX310 offering all the latest ports, including USB-C, and the option of a beautiful QHD+ (3,200 x 1,800) display, complete with 178 degrees of rotation and a serious case of the anti-glare.Arguably, the MacBook Air is no more, but the clones never stop coming. Among them is the Acer Aspire S 13. It’s not quite as thin and light as many prominently featured Ultrabooks, nor is it particularly premium. However, the Aspire S 13 packs quite a punch when it comes to performance. USB-C and a full HD display put it just over the edge in beating out the 13-inch Air, and for a much lower cost. Despite the powerful CPU, the Acer Aspire S 13 even manages a battery life of 7 hours and 49 minutes, according to our testing.It is relatively pricey, but this Inspiron absolutely nails it when it comes to value, especially for hardcore gamers. This is among the strongest laptops housing Nvidia's new, low-end GTX 1050 graphics chips. The latest Intel Core series processors, full HD displays and tons of storage options make the Inspiron 15 Gaming a fine solution for PC gamers on a budget.Lenovo has crafted a brilliant, forward-thinking device that could very well create a subcategory in computing all of its own. The modest specs hold it back from taking on the big boys in terms of raw power, but the innovative digital touchpad keyboard and drawing surface look like trendsetters to us. The Android version is currently about $100 cheaper than the Windows one (click ""see all prices"" above to see all options).Before Asus's latest flipping Chromebook came around, pickings were slim when it came to affordable models with full-on Intel Core processors and 1080p displays, not to mention touchscreens, backlit keyboards and USB-C ports. It may use an Intel Pentium chip on the low-end, but the Asus Chromebook Flip is by no means low-end. Compared to what’s offered by the competition, the Asus Chromebook Flip’s value is unparalleled, and that’s without getting into its pristine tablet mode, which blows other hybrids completely out of the water.7. Microsoft Surface Pro 4The tablet that can replace your laptopLarger, sharper screenVastly improved Type CoverType Cover still sold separatelyTiny battery life improvementsCan a tablet really replace your laptop or home PC? That's still up for debate, but the best tablet trying to make that happen is the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 – and it does a fine job with the full blown version of Windows 10, an integrated kickstand and optional keyboard attachment. Great for for creative professionals, students and everyday folks alike – it's only the premium price that pushes it down the list, but if you're willing to pay for it, you're getting a lot of power – a lot.Not quite what you're looking for?

Only for AT&T customers who want a rugged Galaxy S8 and can’t fathom buying a case, but can spend up to $280 extra.ForBattery life that forgives forgetfulnessBeautiful, pixel-dense displayA fantastic cameraAgainstCosts more than a standard Galaxy S8 with a great case4K video is a lost causePoor button and sensor placementsThe Galaxy S8 Active borrows some of the best aspects of the standard Samsung Galaxy S8, and puts them into a chassis that's more prepared for a busy and accident-prone lifestyle. The result is a long-lasting phone effectively built into its own case.If you’re looking for a phone that offers the best performance without living on the bleeding edge of design, the Galaxy S8 Active may just be that phone. It’s ready for the occasional tumble, whether that be onto hard ground or a puddle. Brush off any dust, dirt or water, and it’s good to go.There are some caveats, though. First, it’s $850, well above the price of the Galaxy S8, and it’s currently an AT&T exclusive for the moment. It sacrifices aesthetics big time, and its ruggedness doesn’t prevent unsightly dings and nicks.Great hardware and a beautiful display keep things fast and pretty, and the massive battery can keep the phone running for ages. But, it suffers from the same poor placement of sensors and buttons as the Galaxy S8, and Bixby doesn’t make everything better, so it can be tedious to use. The Galaxy S8 Active has a great photo camera, but the new fad that is 4K video recording was less than dazzling on this device.At its best, the Galaxy S8 Active is a simple and vastly more robust repackaging of the Galaxy S8 just like in the previous generation, but it's definitely not the right fit for everyone.Design and ruggednessThe Galaxy S8 Active is built to look rugged. It takes the same tall display panel found in the Galaxy S8, flattens it, and reinforces its every edge with metal and plastic bumpers.The body is what Samsung describes as “military-grade.” It has an IP68 rating against dust and water ingress, so it can hang out in 5 feet of water for half an hour (Note: the standard Galaxy S8 is also IP68 rated). But Samsung didn’t stop the testing there, as it earned the Galaxy S8 Active a passing grade for the MIL-STD-810G military specification testing, which puts the phone through intensive temperature, dust, shock, vibration, pressure, and altitude testing. The LG G6 and LG V30 are a few other recent smartphones to carry such a distinction.The S8 Active has an all-glass front that is shatter-resistant up to five feet if dropped on a flat surface, thanks to Gorilla Glass 5, which the normal Galaxy S8 also has. In my drop test, the phone shrugged off a five foot drop face-first onto a solid stone floor. The metal frame extends above the surface of the screen, so it should absorb the impact on flat surfaces.. Meanwhile, the rear of the phone is made to look metallic, with a concrete-like texture, but actually feels and sounds like it may be plain old plastic.For ports, it features a single speaker grille on the bottom, alongside a USB-C port and a 3.5mm headphone jack. There’s a SIM-card slot on the top, power button on the right and volume buttons and a dedicated Bixby button on the left. On the phone’s rear side sits its 12MP camera surrounded by a heart rate sensor and a fingerprint scanner, both of which are hard to find without turning the phone over.In the process of making the Galaxy S8 Active more rugged than the standard Galaxy S8, Samsung sacrificed aesthetics in a big way. The Galaxy S8 Active isn’t exactly ugly (until it meets pavement), and even has a utilitarian sort of charm, but its blocky look can’t compare to the sleek appeal of the Galaxy S8 with its curved edges.Because the Galaxy S8 Active is branded as a device capable of more survivability than your typical phone, the ruggedness of the phone deserves its own section. At first glance, the phone looks rugged, thanks to the wide metal frame and extra metal bumpers screwed on at each end.The design ought to offer better protection than the standard Galaxy S8 or Samsung Galaxy Note 8, as the metal edges raise slightly above screen level, so they’ll take the hit on a flat surface. There’s no glass back on the Galaxy S8 Active either, so there’s less to shatter back there. I let the phone take a few tumbles that it easily shrugged off. That said, the structural integrity of the Galaxy S8 Active doesn’t help it resist scratching to the metal and plastic surfaces, which will clearly display where they’ve hit concrete. They don’t like keys either, and a solid design shouldn’t be equated with a license for carelessness for this phone – it’s not an old Nokia.While I was making a sandwich, I let the Galaxy S8 Active play around in the sink. As could be expected, the touchscreen went haywire, and the fingerprint scanner wasn’t registering fingerprints with all the water everywhere. But after a quick pat dry, it was back in action. A notification appeared on the phone stating that moisture was detected in the port, so I and anyone else would know not to try charging the phone until it had fully dried out.DisplayOn the plus side, the screen is still phenomenal, just like that of the Galaxy S8. You won’t suffer from a lack of crispness, as the Galaxy S8 Active packs in a 5.8-inch display with a resolution of 2,960 x 1,440. Oddly, the phone was set to run at a reduced resolution by default, not taking advantage of all the pixels, and actually making text and small icons blurry. This was one of the first things I corrected, letting the pixel density of the display shine.Making the display all the better is the Super AMOLED technology, which offers incredible picture quality thanks to its high contrast ratio. And while some AMOLED displays can be a bit dim, I found the Galaxy S8 Active display was easy to see even when strolling down the street at noon on a cloudless day, though watching video content in the sun wasn’t so great.As more top-of-the-line smartphones move away from bezels, shrinking or doing away with them entirely, the Galaxy S8 Active does feel like it’s behind the curve. This high-end display is surrounded on all sides by a noticeable bezel. And since the bezels are black, they do occasional blend in with the screen when there’s dark imagery or backgrounds on the phone’s display.",Samsung Galaxy S8 Active review,http://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8-active,http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5vgWAEqHoCYXrbiVXc8gag-1200-80.jpg,technology,us,"The latest technology news and reviews, covering computing, home entertainment systems, gadgets and more.",en,TechRadar,['top'],http://www.techradar.com,"{'large': '', 'small': '', 'medium': ''}",13:54:37,2017,2017-09-27 00:00:00,2017-09-25 00:00:00,2017-09-01 00:00:00,2017-07-01 00:00:00

Well, okay, a little bit of it is. But knowing who’s following you can help you decide what content you want to share, what kind of people you want to reach most and, in some cases, which people you really need to block from seeing anything at all.Unfortunately getting the information you want about your social networks is not always as simple as you might like. On some services you get the very minimum of information, while on others the features that enabled you to spot spammers, bots and shameless self-promoters have been rolled back.Don’t despair, though. As we’ll discover, there are plenty of ways to find out exactly who’s appreciating your online activities - and just because a particular site doesn’t want to offer a particular feature doesn’t mean a third party app won’t provide it instead. From YouTube subscribers to LinkedIn contacts, Facebook friends and followers to Instagram addicts, we’ll explore the best ways to see how sociable you are and the tools you can use to find out more.PrevPage 1 of 6Next PrevPage 1 of 6NextThird-party Instagram apps shouldn’t technically let you see unfollowers, but some still do1. See who's following you on InstagramFinding out who follows you on Instagram used to be tortuous, but it’s much easier since the service made big changes last year: just log in to the website, tap on the profile icon and then tap 'Followers'. Tapping on the name of the person lets you see who they’re following and who follows them; if you just want to follow somebody back then the big blue 'Follow' button does exactly that.One thing Instagram doesn’t let you do is spot the rascals who follow people, wait for you to follow back and then immediately unfollow you again – a common trick used by people who want to boost their follower numbers without actually engaging with anybody.That used to be something you could do with third-party apps, but in December 2016 Instagram made big changes to its terms and conditions that expressly forbade third-party applications from using follower information for anything other than analytics. However, unauthorized apps still offer the information Instagram says they shouldn’t. One of the best is Followers & Likes Manager for Instagram, which is available for Apple devices.Or you could just be more cynical about who you follow back, choosing only to follow people whose content you actually want to see.PrevPage 2 of 6Next PrevPage 2 of 6NextAs you can see from Joanna here, not all followers are worth paying attention to2. See who's following you on TwitterThe simplest way to see who follows you on Twitter is to use the Twitter website or app. Click on 'Followers' to see who’s following you and 'Lists' to see what lists people have added you to.That's handy, but there's much more data available if you know where to look. Twitter Analytics shows your most popular tweets and the most popular people you follow, and if you click on the Audiences link you can see what kind of people follow you, why and where from.If you’d like to know which people follow you back on Twitter, the excellent ManageFlitter can tell you. You can easily see which accounts haven’t posted for ages, which ones don’t follow you back and which ones appear to be fake or spam accounts, and you can unfollow them automatically. It also provides interesting stats on how busy accounts are and whether they’re following spectacularly high numbers of people, which usually suggests self-promotion rather than engagement.PrevPage 3 of 6Next PrevPage 3 of 6NextIf your settings enable you to have followers, you’ll see a link to them on your friends page. If they don’t, you won’t3. See who's following you on FacebookFacebook is complicated. There are two kinds of connections that you can have with people on Facebook: friends, who are people you’ve explicitly friended on Facebook, and followers, who may be complete strangers.Friends are always followers, but if you make posts public then it’s possible for non-friends to follow you too – and if you ignore or delete friend requests, those people automatically become followers who can see your public posts.To see who’s following you, go to your profile page and click 'Friends'. If you’ve made it possible for people to follow you you’ll see a 'Followers' link; if you haven’t, you won’t.Most followers are just interested in what you’re posting, but if you fear that someone’s following you for more sinister reasons then it’s possible to block individual people without disabling the following feature altogether. To do that, go to the account settings page and look for 'Blocking' (it’s just below 'Privacy'). This enables you to block people altogether, to restrict specific contacts from seeing friends-only posts, or to block messages or apps either on a per-app or per-person-who-keeps-sending-you-invites basis. You can also block people from contacting you via Facebook Messenger.PrevPage 4 of 6Next PrevPage 4 of 6NextLinkedIn shows you the most recent followers first. Keep an eye on your profile for any recommendations4. See who's following you on LinkedInLinkedIn makes it easy to see who’s following you. Go to your profile icon, click on it and select 'Manage', followed by 'Posts and activity'. You should now see a timeline with a box at the left of the screen and the options 'Manage', 'Your followers' and 'Your drafts'.If you click on 'Your followers' you’ll see a screen full of avatars sorted by the date they followed you (the most recent followers appear at the top). You can see at a glance whether you follow each person and if you don’t it’s just a matter of clicking on the '+' button to add them to your network.LinkedIn has another useful feature on your home page: it can let you see who’s viewed your profile in the last 90 days, although to see the full list you’ll need to have premium membership. Imagine the chaos if Facebook had a similar feature. The difference here is that LinkedIn is, of course, a business network, and the whole point of joining it is for potential business partners, clients or employees to connect with you.Don’t forget to check your own profile too – that’s where you’ll see other people’s recommendations where they sing your praises to the LinkedIn massive. You should be notified automatically of new ones, but spam filters often mean you'll miss a few.PrevPage 5 of 6Next PrevPage 5 of 6NextYouTube offers lots of insight via its Creator Studio, but you can’t identify individuals who liked or disliked your clips5. See who's following you on YouTubeYour connections on YouTube come in three categories: subscribers, commenters, and people who have liked or disliked you videos. To see them go into your account and click on the Creator Studio link.You want to take a look at the Analytics section, which provides an overview of your channel and stacks of information: where your viewers are coming from, how long they stay, what devices they’re using and so on.The most important data here is under Engagement Reports, where you can see your most recent subscribers and your likes and dislikes. Unfortunately, as much as you might like to identify the dislikers and chase them around the internet demanding to know why they don’t love you, you can only see the identity of people who have subscribed to your channel and who have set YouTube to make their subscriptions public.While Google happily provides demographic information on commenters, likes and dislikes, which you can use to work out where your audience comes from, it doesn’t enable you to identify individuals who gave you a thumbs up or down.","See who’s following you on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and more",http://www.techradar.com/how-to/see-whos-following-you-on-instagram-facebook-twitter-and-more,http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a8xGV4Ad9VDwfUaM5hWjWJ-1200-80.jpg,technology,us,"The latest technology news and reviews, covering computing, home entertainment systems, gadgets and more.",en,TechRadar,['top'],http://www.techradar.com,"{'large': '', 'small': '', 'medium': ''}",09:54:15,2017,2017-09-27 00:00:00,2017-09-25 00:00:00,2017-09-01 00:00:00,2017-07-01 00:00:00
4264,4791,Jon Fingas,2017-09-26 23:52:00,Tesla is said to be kissing NVIDIA goodbye and using Intel to power its cars' infotainment units.,latest,2017-09-26T23:52:00Z,0.8775682521812552,engadget,"Tesla switches from NVIDIA to Intel for its infotainment systemsEver since Tesla took the wraps off the Model S, its electric cars have had NVIDIA hardware powering the infotainment system and the giant touchscreen that controls it. However, it's apparently breaking with tradition: Bloombergsources hear that the automaker has switched to Intel. Reportedly, the Model 3 and new versions of other cars will be the first to make the leap. It's not certain what prompted the move (Intel, NVIDIA and Tesla have all declined to comment), but it's a huge coup if true.For the most part, NVIDIA's deal with Tesla has been more about prestige than raw numbers. As a luxury EV maker, Tesla wasn't about to sell in huge volumes. That's changing with the Model 3 -- when Tesla has hundreds of thousands of pre-orders, the bottom line suddenly matters a great deal. Intel is hopping aboard right as Tesla's unit sales will make a significant difference for component partners. Combine that with Intel's other victories, such as its Waymo deal, and it's quickly becoming a fierce competitor in the automotive world.It's doubtful that NVIDIA will be crying in its Corn Flakes, even if the loss is significant. It already has established brands like Audi, Toyota and Volvo in its pocket, and it's bound to play a crucial role as EVs and self-driving cars take hold. If it had any dreams of overwhelming dominance, though, it'll have to put them on hold for the time being.As for how this affects your in-car experience? It's hard to say, but this would be a prime opportunity for Tesla to upgrade the performance of its infotainment tech. That's rather important when the Model 3 depends almost entirely on its touchscreen -- you don't want any delays while you're navigating an unfamiliar system or turning up the AC.",Tesla switches from NVIDIA to Intel for its infotainment systems,https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/26/tesla-switches-to-intel-for-infotainment/,https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630&quality=80&image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Fea693a4f6f1367a6b3f4ba5e83c9d8d%2F205708261%2Fmodel-3-dashboard-head-on-view-1.jpg&client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&signature=3385c67ea20011266e5a0a90c8e4241bd71701a2,technology,us,Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics.,en,Engadget,['top'],https://www.engadget.com,"{'large': '', 'small': '', 'medium': ''}",23:52:00,2017,2017-09-27 00:00:00,2017-09-25 00:00:00,2017-09-01 00:00:00,2017-07-01 00:00:00

The hovercraft, built by Kalashnikov Concern, gets its lift from 16 sets of rotors and appears to run on battery power, not fuel. It's likely that a future version of this vehicle might be used by military as Kalashnikov is already involved in the production of guns and ammunition as well as combat vehicles and automated gun systems.Aside from the rotors, the vehicle has a seat, joysticks for maneuvering and a metal skeleton but not much else. There's no cover as of now, but the video below shows a shell added on, suggesting that it's an addition planned for future prototypes.Having small, flying vehicles like this one is appealing to military. They could, in theory, be used for similar sorts of missions as helicopters but with much lower costs and less intrusion. The US military has been working on its own hoverbike with Malloy Aeronautics, which they showed off in a successful flight demo earlier this year. And outside of military applications, Hoversurf has been working on a hoverbike intended for civilian use, though that one looks at little scary.Kalashnikov's doesn't look particularly scary, but it does look a little windy -- that shell would definitely be useful.

The company has announced a $20 million investment in Dreamscape Immersive, a VR storytelling studio with a focus on room-scale installations and real-time motion tracking.AMC plans to put six VR stations in its multiplexes in North America and the UK over the next year and a half, according to a press release. That number is key: Unlike things like the John Wick VR experience, or the ones made for Interstellar or Alien: Covenant, Dreamscape's are social in nature, supporting up to six ""players"" at a time.The Verge reports that the installation spaces will be 16' x 16' walkable spaces with a railing around the perimeter. Haptic floors, fans and scents can be implemented if the experience calls for them. Users will wear a VR headset, a backpack computer and a few sensors for motion tracking. The result is life-size avatars that act and react in real-time with your body's movements.Info about what those experiences could be isn't available, but half of AMC's investment is earmarked specifically for making them.

According to a new report at The Information, Airbnb is looking to take a step even further with company-branded apartments in Florida.According to The Information, Airbnb is working with a real estate developer in southern Florida, Newgard Development Group, to design a new apartment building as a proof of concept near Orlando in Kissimmee, right next to all those theme parks. Airbnb won't own or even contribute to the development costs, said one person familiar with the matter. Another source said that this is only one of many experiments that Airbnb is using to expand its brand to more places.The idea, say The Information 's sources, is to pull in younger renters who work part-time in Orlando, but want to make money by subletting rooms or apartments (via Airbnb) when they aren't in town. Airbnb, the developer and the main apartment tenants would split the revenue earned from such an arrangement. It sounds like this could bring Airbnb one step closer to becoming like a hotel chain, notes The Information.

4271,4800,Mallory Locklear,2017-09-26 18:51:00,Homeland Security introduced a new rule that would add immigrants' social media info to their official records.,latest,2017-09-26T18:51:00Z,0.9861707200762996,engadget,"The DHS plans to monitor immigrants’ social media accountsThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recently posted a new rule in the Federal Register set to go into effect next month. The update is largely to note that certain government electronic documents are also part of immigrants' official records as the DHS ""moves to conducting more immigrant actions in an electronic environment."" However, the DHS is also adding new categories to official records including ""social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information, and search results."" And the collection of social media information isn't limited to new immigrants but will apply to all immigrants including permanent residents and naturalized citizens.This move is certainly not out of the blue -- incorporating social media information into immigrant records in one way or another has been a topic of conversation for a while. In 2015, the DHS began working on a plan to add social media searches into visa application protocol and in 2016 it proposed and implemented a new section in the travel form for foreign visitors coming to the US under the visa waiver program that asks for social media handles. In February, the DHS announced that it was planning to start asking visitors from Trump's travel ban list of countries for not only their social account names, but their passwords as well. And in March reports came out that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson ordered social media checks on all visa applicants who had visited ISIS-controlled regions. Additionally, after proposing the plan in May, the Trump administration introduced an expanded visa applicant questionnaire in June that asks for all social media handles used in the last five years.In regards to the new DHS rule, Electronic Frontier Foundation attorney Adam Schwartz told BuzzFeed, ""There's a growing trend at the Department of Homeland Security to be snooping on the social media of immigrants and foreigners and we think it's an invasion of privacy and deters freedom of speech.""The new rule is open for public comment until October 18th when it will officially be implemented.",The DHS plans to monitor immigrants’ social media accounts,https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/26/dhs-monitor-immigrants-social-media/,https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630&quality=80&image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fimages%2Fdims%3Fcrop%3D3000%252C1999%252C0%252C0%26quality%3D85%26format%3Djpg%26resize%3D1600%252C1067%26image_uri%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fo.aolcdn.com%252Fhss%252Fstorage%252Fmidas%252Fe2269795494b7ddcfc2aca81b659c72%252F205076352%252F649149528.jpg%26client%3Da1acac3e1b3290917d92%26signature%3Df3b890ca438b3397039212b5ea2f962969374b85&client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&signature=a8cca859178018d87fd533a579d68899a029bf10,technology,us,Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics.,en,Engadget,['top'],https://www.engadget.com,"{'large': '', 'small': '', 'medium': ''}",18:51:00,2017,2017-09-27 00:00:00,2017-09-25 00:00:00,2017-09-01 00:00:00,2017-07-01 00:00:00
4298,4862,Nelson A. Denis,2017-09-26 08:27:07,The Jones Act has outlived its original World War I intent and is devastating the island’s economy.,latest,2017-09-26T08:27:07Z,0.0565891472868217,hacker-news,"Hurricane Maria was the most powerful storm to hit Puerto Rico in more than 80 years. It left the entire island without electricity, which may take six months to restore. It toppled trees, shattered windows, tore off roofs and turned streets into rivers throughout the island.President Trump declared that “Puerto Rico was absolutely obliterated” and issued a federal disaster declaration. But the United States needs to do more. It needs to suspend the Jones Act in Puerto Rico.After World War I, America was worried about German U-boats, which had sunk nearly 5,000 ships during the war. Congress enacted the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, a.k.a. the Jones Act, to ensure that the country maintained a shipbuilding industry and seafaring labor force. Section 27 of this law decreed that only American ships could carry goods and passengers from one United States port to another. In addition, every ship must be built, crewed and owned by American citizens.Almost a century later, there are no U-boats lurking off the coast of Puerto Rico. The Jones Act has outlived its original intent, yet it is strangling the island’s economy.The foreign vessel has one other option: It can reroute to Jacksonville, Fla., where all the goods will be transferred to an American vessel, then shipped to Puerto Rico where — again — all the rerouting costs are passed through to the consumer.Thanks to the law, the price of goods from the United States mainland is at least double that in neighboring islands, including the United States Virgin Islands, which are not covered by the Jones Act. Moreover, the cost of living in Puerto Rico is 13 percent higher than in 325 urban areas elsewhere in the United States, even though per capita income in Puerto Rico is about $18,000, close to half that of Mississippi, the poorest of all 50 states.An error has occurred. Please try again later.You are already subscribed to this email.This is a shakedown, a mob protection racket, with Puerto Rico a captive market. The island is the fifth-largest market in the world for American products, and there are more Walmarts and Walgreens per square mile in Puerto Rico than anywhere else on the planet.A 2012 report by two University of Puerto Rico economists found that the Jones Act caused a $17 billion loss to the island’s economy from 1990 through 2010. Other studies have estimated the Jones Act’s damage to Puerto Rico, Hawaii and Alaska to be $2.8 billion to $9.8 billion per year. According to all these reports, if the Jones Act did not exist, then neither would the public debt of Puerto Rico.The U-boats are gone and a protectionist law has been exposed. The crony capitalism of the Jones Act does not “protect” anyone and it is choking the economy of Puerto Rico. If the United States has any interest in the hurricane-battered people of Puerto Rico, it needs to take the law off their necks — and now.Recovering from the disaster will be difficult no matter what, but the Jones Act will make it that much harder.Food costs twice as much in Puerto Rico as in Florida. Jones Act relief will save many Puerto Ricans — especially children and seniors — from potential starvation. Jones Act relief will also enable islanders to find medicine, especially Canadian pharmaceuticals, at lifesaving rates. And it will give islanders access to international oil markets — crucial for running its electric grid — devoid of a 30 percent Jones Act markup.And suspending or repealing the law is crucial to the arduous rebuilding process ahead. In one town alone, 70,000 people were evacuated because of a failing dam. Jones Act relief will enable residents to buy materials, rebuild their homes and prevent an explosion of homelessness.This is not just about recovering from Hurricane Maria. It is also about Puerto Rico’s long-term future. If the Jones Act were suspended, consumer prices would drop by 15 percent to 20 percent and energy costs would plummet. A post-Jones Puerto Rico could modernize its infrastructure and develop its own island-based shipping industry. Indeed, the island could become a shipping hub between South America, the Caribbean and the rest of the world. This industry would generate thousands of jobs and opportunities for skilled laborers and small businesses. On an island with official unemployment over 10 percent (but actually closer to 25 percent), this would energize their entire work force.A humanitarian crisis is about to explode in Puerto Rico. But the consequences of Jones Act relief would be immediate and powerful. This is not the time to price-gouge the entire population. It is time for Congress to act ethically and responsibly and suspend the Jones Act in Puerto Rico.Nelson A.

In polls, including a recent one for National Poetry Day, The Owl and the Pussycat is often voted our favourite poem. Anyone who has ever doodled a limerick, of any tone or topic, pays homage to his genius. As well as timeless nonsense such as The Jumblies, there’s also his art – brilliantly studied paintings of exotic creatures in far-off lands; luminous desertscapes; antic sketches of men with birds in their beards – work that puts him in a class of his own as an important Victorian artist.Edward Lear is one of those English one-offs who are treasured because they seem to suggest that there are no more important things to do than paint or write, and who embody a benign, provisional and above all amateur spirit. Lear himself, slyly complicit, summarised his place in the English cultural landscape with a teasing, encrypted self-description:How pleasant to know Mr Lear! Who has written such volumes of stuff! Some think him ill-tempered and queer, But a few think him pleasant enough.He was born in London in 1812, the same year as Charles Dickens, one of at least 17, or was it 19 (his mother lost count; there were infant deaths)? Young Edward was both swept up in, and set apart from, this brood. With good reason, he always felt different. By the age of five, he was not only a boy among many sisters, but also diagnosed as epileptic, a lifelong terror he shared with Lewis Carroll. Epilepsy would be one of the secrets that made him solitary, while his atrocious eyesight “formed everything into a horror”. Lear’s nonconformist parents hardly compensated for these childhood traumas: both were largely absent. His City broker father was remote; his “shadowy” mother rejected him.Jenny Uglow declares at the outset that she wants to “follow his life straightforwardly”. In this, she’s echoing the discreet and magisterial example of Vivien Noakes who pioneered this elusive subject in 1968 in Edward Lear: The Life of a Wanderer. But Uglow goes much further than Noakes. This, quite rightly, is the half-life of a gay man in a society that had neither language nor tolerance for homosexuality. By chapter two, on top of all his other troubles, young Edward is grappling with some mysterious abuse, “the greatest evil done to me in my life”. What, exactly, this was remains unclear, though Lear recorded the date of the “greatest evil” every year in his diary. Uglow, whose focus on Lear and his confused sexuality is unflinching, is too good a biographer to indulge in reckless speculation here. Clearly, for “pleasant” Mr Lear, nothing would ever again be “straightforward”, especially once he and his beloved sister Ann began to escape into a parallel universe of exquisite botanical drawing. Nonsense verse soon followed. From boyhood, Lear was “three parts crazy”, but “wholly affectionate.” He would only get more like himself.There were few intrusions on his adolescent solitude, apart from birds, especially parrots, his favourites. Some early zoological work inspired his vocation as an artist. Eventually, he would rival Audubon. Parrots also brought him a patron, Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby, whose teeming family exposed Lear to a new audience for his gifts as an entertainer. As an artist, Lear was supposed to remain below stairs with the servants, but Stanley liked to have his protege upstairs to amuse his guests. Where Carroll had Alice and the Liddell family, Lear had the Knowsley nursery, where the Stanley children, their friends and nursemaids, kept riotous company. Unlike Carroll, he did not sentimentalise little girls, betraying no hint of the paedophile. Rather, Lear loved the mayhem of childhood to which nonsense was the only answer. Nonsense was infantile, rude, eccentric and grumpy, as children are. Nonsense could celebrate surreal violence and ghoulish accidents. As a roving landscape painter, Lear could be exquisite. Through his crazy wordplay, he could express his inner torment as a homosexual single man in Victorian England.Windsor did do something for Lear, which was give an awkward, gay man renewed self-confidenceAbroad, in Rome or Corfu, he could be “as happy as a hedgehog” and was free to fall in love with other artists. At home, he had to present himself, half ironically, as a man in need of a wife: “I anticipate the chance of a Mrs Lear”, he wrote, “in 40 years hence.”Unlike some gay Victorians, who went native overseas, it was Lear’s respectable hope that he was “always an Englishman” abroad. “Mr Lear” was certainly a weird bird. As he grew older, this myopic court jester, and nomadic artist, unable to reconcile his sexual with his social self, morphed into his mature, eccentric persona.This was the closet homosexual who, in the summer of 1846, came to teach drawing to Queen Victoria. “How did you get all these beautiful things?” he exclaimed, on first seeing the famous royal collection. “I inherited them, Mr Lear,” replied the Queen.It’s at this point that Jenny Uglow diverges most completely from the narrative line hewn by Vivien Noakes. Uglow’s interest in Lear’s court life is distinctly finite. And yet Windsor did do something for Lear, which was give an awkward, gay man renewed self-confidence. Thus, 1846 also saw the publication of A Book of Nonsense (now an exceedingly rare book). Uglow is good on Lear’s nonsense, attributing just the right amount of consequence to its surreal caprice:There was an Old Person of Rhodes, Who strongly objected to toads; He paid several cousins, To catch them by dozens, That futile Old Person of Rhodes.On his travels again – now to the Holy Land – Lear fell in love with a younger man, Frank Lushington, who would eventually compound Lear’s inner torment. For a while, the senior partner found temporary solace among the pre-Raphaelite brotherhood to whom he looked up as a child among grown-ups, addressing Holman Hunt as “dear Daddy”.Now in his 40s, Lear had become a considerable figure in the mid-Victorian arts world, making friends with Tennyson and especially his wife, Emily, to whom he confessed feeling “jarry and out of tune”.Uglow shows that the life of the Victorian gay man, even in progressive circles, was excruciating. The sexual appetite, wrote one, was “a beast to be suppressed, trampled by the help of surgeons and their cautery of sexual organs”.Only abroad could Lear and Lushington enjoy a semblance of marriage – as Uglow puts it – “without the sex”. But then, how “queer” was Mr Lear? When he and his manservant Giorgio visited Mount Athos, Lear fled screaming from the Holy Mountain and its “mournful, minced fish and marmalade masticating Monx [sic]”.In middle age, Lear’s wordplay had become quasi-Joycean, writes Uglow, “alive, protean, ever evolving, and finding new endings, like new limbs”. This is the Lear beloved of Auden and Eliot. He was, says Uglow, “an eerie, queery, sometimes weary, sometimes cheery Edward Lear”.When “cheery”, he enjoyed moments that were “splendidophoropherostiphongious”, but there was always a terrible sadness, too, that only nonsense could assuage.In 1861, Lear published a new Book of Nonsense, a huge success that would establish him as a classic. Four years later, Lewis Carroll published Alice in Wonderland, a very different kettle of fish, steeped in logic and literary allusion. These two Victorian giants never met, and Lear read Alice “without comment”.Lear’s world, unlike Dodgson’s Oxford idyll, was provisional, nomadic and fraught. Lushington got married and Lear tortured himself with matrimonial fantasies. He would be “forever roaming with a hungry heart”.Finally, the gaiety and sadness of Lear’s life expressed itself in his four greatest poems: The Owl and the Pussycat, The Dong With a Luminous Nose, Some Incidents in the Life of My Uncle Arly and The Jumblies, warbling their “moony song”. He might recognise that he had gone “to sea in a sieve”, but he admonished his diary that “the morbids are not allowed”. This extraordinary Englishman died in self-imposed isolation in San Remo aged 75.

(It’s making kids furniture, too.)As an added enticement, The Inside, which relies on 3D imaging and digital printing, also promises fast delivery. Specifically, it says it can make its furniture in just to six to nine days and ship it directly via UPS from where it’s made in Chicago. (Typically, custom upholstered pieces take anywhere from eight to twelve weeks to create.)We talked with Lemieux earlier today to understand better what she’s aiming to do. Our exchange has been edited slightly for length.TC: Why pursue this idea right now?CL: What consumers have had up until now is a sea of gray product that all looks the same. Anyone in furniture retail knows this formula: inventory plus protracted design cycles plus large minimum order quantities plus long lead times plus and onerous logistics equals big pain points — also known as the traditional supply chain.Like most retail companies, at DwellStudio, we also followed this cycle: design, sample, manufacture and import. This process typically takes 18 months from start to finish and because of the minimum order quantity from manufacturing partners, the selection becomes narrow quickly to avoid inventory exposure.I really saw a hole in the market here – where consumers were lacking choices in design, fashionably fun furniture and accessibility, as well as fast shipping. With The Inside, we’re aiming to reimagine the furniture industry by leveraging virtual manufacturing and a zero inventory model to offer unique designs made with incredible speed.TC: What is the full range of furniture pieces that can be made?CL: The Inside has over 800 SKUs and an incredibly wide-ranging selection of fabric patterns, so in addition to choice, we also want to give shoppers a very curated offering. We have tons of amazing guest designers in the pipeline — right now we’re launching with Peter Som and Claire V — that we’ll be rolling out post-launch.TC: What type of fabrics are you using?CL: The printed upholstery is cotton linen or linen. This is the most popular ground cloth for furniture.TC: What is the company’s return policy?CL: We have a 30-day return policy.TC: What are some of the prices that customers can expect to pay?CL: Products are priced for shoppers who love to mix it up by exploring different styles and trying new trends without having to commit to long-term investments. The Inside’s prices start at $219 with an average price point of $300: Our Queen-size headboards start at $499, for example, and the average price is $559. Our Ottomans start at $219 and the average cost is $429. Our accent chairs start at $349 and average $489.TC: Where is this furniture available to buy? Are you partnering with other stores or is it available through your site only?CL: Everything is made-to-order, so we carry no inventory. We digitally print the fabric, so the footprint stays amazingly small and there’s no fabric waste. We use virtual manufacturing, a digital design process that uses 3D models to allow for products to be adaptive.TC: How do you overcome the concern that “fast furniture” could suggest slightly shoddier furniture, as with fast fashion?CL: Consumers can expect our furniture to still be high quality, as well as unique to many other choices out there. With our zero-inventory model, we’re able to offer unique designs at attainable prices as a solution to the cost-efficient imports that inundate the market while maintaining a precise attention to detail and an emphasis on quality.TC: Forerunner is known for a portfolio of companies that use innovative marketing tactics. What’s in Inside’s bag of tricks? Print catalogs? Facebook ads?CL: We’re of the mindset that you need to try everything, because the landscape is changing constantly. Because we’re creating beautiful interiors, imagery and content will be central to our marketing. We will also be partnering with a wide range of collaborators allowing us to speak to consumers in unique ways. And we see some of the more traditional routes like direct mail as being an important part of the acquisition strategy.TC: Everyone has pieces they’d probably love to refurbish affordably. Do you see a day when The Inside refurbishes existing furniture with its fabrics or is that too far afield from what you’re working on?CL: This is definitely something we’re considering for the future. We’re just focusing on launch right now.TC: What do you see as the company’s target demographic?CL: Consumers who crave style, exclusivity, and adaptability to accommodate their transient and urban lifestyles.Our goal is to turn “social media inspo” into a reality with signature assortments of stylish and eclectic furniture, purposefully curated to bring all of the most Instagram-worthy Pinterest boards to life.","The Inside, a maker of so-called fast furniture, lands $1.5 million from Forerunner",https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/the-inside-a-maker-of-so-called-fast-furniture-lands-1-5-million-from-forerunner/,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/stool-large-790x505.jpg,technology,us,"TechCrunch is a leading technology media property, dedicated to obsessively profiling startups, reviewing new Internet products, and breaking tech news.",en,TechCrunch,['top'],https://techcrunch.com,"{'large': '', 'small': '', 'medium': ''}",00:29:01,2017,2017-09-28 00:00:00,2017-09-25 00:00:00,2017-09-01 00:00:00,2017-07-01 00:00:00

For Samsung Gear VR content, it’s a lot tighter. Users can’t exceed 30 minutes of playtime and have to have purchased the title within the past three days. The refund policy also will not apply to movies, bundles or in-app purchases.Users can request refunds through the purchase history page.People have been saying VR has a problem with content quantity and quality, and while the former definitely appears to be getting solved as time goes on, the latter is a bit trickier. It isn’t in anybody’s best interest for people to download a game, have an awful experience and then grow discouraged from investing in future content. For Oculus, the content team has to get people comfortable with paying for high quality stuff.Nevertheless this is all a bit complicated for developers. Users who drop $20 on a title expecting what they’d get from a comparable console game are never going to be pleased with VR. The market is so much smaller that unless devs have substantial VC subsidization, the margins aren’t going to allow them to basically give away content their teams labored away on. I would expect some backlash from developers, especially regarding the length of time users can play a game before deciding they don’t want to keep it.The new refund policy is live now, the company details that the process should take no more than five days to initiate a refund if the request is eligible.",Oculus will start refunding users for bad VR content,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/oculus-will-start-refunding-users-for-bad-vr-content/,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/oculus-home.jpg,technology,us,"TechCrunch is a leading technology media property, dedicated to obsessively profiling startups, reviewing new Internet products, and breaking tech news.",en,TechCrunch,['top'],https://techcrunch.com,"{'large': '', 'small': '', 'medium': ''}",00:08:48,2017,2017-09-28 00:00:00,2017-09-25 00:00:00,2017-09-01 00:00:00,2017-07-01 00:00:00

Easy enough, right?Not so much.There are plenty of complex terms, clauses, provisions and other conditions written into investment agreements. So in this series, “A Startup Takes Flight,” we’re exploring how some of the most common funding terms affect the fundraising process. To do so, we made up a company called the Internet of Wings, Inc. (abbreviated “IoW”) and followed its path.We’ve previously worked through the basics of startup share structures. and common financial instruments used in seed deals, pre- and post-money valuations. In our second installment, we learned how pro rata clauses work and how to calculate the minimum investment required to maintain the same proportional stake in a company.So far it’s been a pretty good run for our made-up company. It has raised money on decent terms. Here’s the capitalization table after Series B:And here’s how the share structure broke down by stage after Series B:However, on the suggestion of the board, it was decided that the company should undertake a strategic pivot; we’ll see how that turns out. In the process, we will learn about down rounds, share conversions and ratchet-based antidilution protections.State of the WingIt’s been a couple of years since Jill and Jack raised their Series B. However, executing such a pivot would prove to be expensive.Their shift in strategy involved an expansion of their business away from simple drone-based delivery of chicken sandwiches. In order to be the drone-based logistics layer for all restaurants, they set up outposts in far-flung cities like Los Angeles, Boston and Austin, TX.Inspired by gourds used to serve $14 artisanal yerba maté at a Mission District cantina they often frequented, Jack designed and began manufacturing a line of modular packaging that could contain everything from ramen to breakfast tacos. Remarking on the slightly oblong shape and white color of his containers, Jill joked: “I think we can finally answer the question. Chicken definitely came before the egg.”It was not all smooth sailing, though. Minor hardware malfunctions resulted in dropped payloads. Most memorably, a class of slightly passive-aggressive elementary school students sent a copy of Judi Barrett’s classic Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs to HQ after a drone accidentally dropped a party-sized egg of baked ziti as it flew over their playground at recess.There were some bugs in the routing software, too. Skirting a little too close to LAX, a drone was taken out by one of the trained falcons otherwise tasked with dispatching birds before they get sucked into passing jet engines. A press photo showed the raptor nibbling steak tartare out of the drone’s payload. A long and drawn out investigation by the FAA ensued.More seriously, the company found it surprisingly difficult to acquire customers. Takeout restaurants were hesitant to allow the drones with their hissing, squealing buzz fly near their businesses. Without the special bays and “Drone Zones” integrated into the Internet of Wings’s production facilities, more traditional restaurants found it difficult to integrate drones into their delivery workflows.Tensions were also rising among the co-founders.“I knew from the beginning that this ‘pivot and become a platform’ advice wasn’t good,” said Jack to Jill after everyone else went home. “You know they just wanted us to scale up so they can get a 10x exit on their investment, right?”“There’s something definitely wrong here,” agreed Jill. “But there has to be a technical solution to customer concerns. Maybe we could put something around the rotors to reduce noise? Something soft, like feathers or some bio-mimicked material perhaps?”IoW’s Series C dynamicsThe Internet of Wings has not been living up to investor expectations. Raising, much less keeping, the $50 million Series B valuation was an order that got taller by the day.In VC parlance, a “down” round is a financing round with a lower share price than the previous round. And in venture capital investing agreements, there are often a series of provisions included to protect investors from being diluted during down rounds.As the name suggests, antidilution provisions protect previous investors from dilution in down rounds.Like we discussed in the case of pro rata provisions, antidilution protections help investors maintain their proportional influence in a company. Things like board seats and votes are often allocated as a function of how much equity a given shareholder (in this case, an investor) controls. A shareholder doesn’t want that kind of influence snatched away from them by some other investor swooping in to buy up lots of cheap shares in a down round. This is one of the primary reasons for an investor to build in a price adjustment mechanism into their agreement with the company.Back to our founders…“Jack, stop it with the poultry puns. It’s getting really annoying and people are going to stop listening to you,” said an increasingly exasperated Jill. “But back to business, if we raised just a bit more money, maybe we could make this work? With another iteration on the drone technology, and a better on-site deployment strategy for our customers, we could be in the clear here.”“IoW’s no spring chicken though,” said Jack, stifling a smile as he dropped another pun. “Given the slow growth of business, and the FAA breathing down our necks after the LAX incident, we’re not going to keep — much less grow — our $50 million valuation from our previous round, and that’s going to really, really suck for us. We’re going to be diluted down to nothing.”“Not nothing,” said Jill. “But it’s still going to be tough. Look, we’ve got nine months of runway. After that, we’ve got nothing besides some drones, a few leases on some buildings, desks, laptops and a couple dozen employees who are going to be out of a job.” Jill, now appealing to the hungrier side of her co-founder’s psyche, offered, “If we stick this through, we can at least save this boondoggle and get something out of the years we’ve spent on this. It’s a slog, but it’s our slog.”“You have no idea how much I want to fly the coop, Jill. But birds of a feather flock together, so we’re in this to the end, whether I like it or not. Guess we’ve got to call the board.”The roundJill, Jack and the rest of the board collectively agree that Internet of Wings will need to raise another $10 million in a Series C round. This would be just enough money to sustain the company for another four to five quarters as it retrofitted its drones, worked with customers to regain momentum lost in the pivot and begin seeking exit options if the company failed to grow as expected.Jack and Jill’s concerns came home to roost. Investors valued their company significantly below their previous $50 million valuation. Because of the regulatory pressure, sluggish growth and rumors that a major corporation is considering an entrance into drone-based delivery, IoW’s investors valued the company at $30 million pre-money. With roughly 27.5 million shares outstanding prior to the Series C financing, the company’s shares are now priced at roughly $1.091 per share (calculated by dividing the pre-money valuation by the number of shares outstanding prior to new financing), a change of negative 40 percent from the share price at Series B.Before continuing, let’s digest some of the numbers related to this offering, because knowing how many shares are being created will be important for our antidilution calculations. To find the number of shares being issued, we simply divide the total amount of money being raised ($10 million) by the price at which shares are being offered ($1.091). The result of that simple arithmetic: we calculated that 9,165,902 Series C shares will be issued.With that figured out, here’s the breakdown of what’s being invested in the round:Cormorant Ventures is investing $6 million for 5,499,541 Series C shares, 15 percent of the company, undiluted.BlackBox Capital is investing $4 million for 3,666,361 Series C shares, 10 percent of the company, undiluted.Provident Capital is not participating in the round.But this is just the investment for this Series C round. Prior investors had antidilution clauses written into their investment agreements with the Internet of Wings. So let’s see how those terms affect the conversion price of extant Series B shares. Not sure what conversion price means? Fret not, because we’ll explain.Antidilution terms from IoW’s Series BIoW had three investors in its $15 million Series B round. The antidilution provisions worked out by each investor are as follows:BlackBox capital invested $3.5 million and negotiated a full ratchet clause.There are two primary approaches to fulfilling antidilution clauses. The first, and perhaps most obvious one, is to issue new shares according to the type of agreement reached during the prior financing event. However, according to a highly referenced blog post by Brad Feld from 2005 on the subject, “it’s a silly and unnecessarily complicated approach that merely increases the amount the lawyers can bill the company for the financing.”Rather, Feld and others suggest merely adjusting the price at which preferred shares can convert to common shares. In most startup shareholder agreements, preferred stock carries the option, but not the obligation, to convert to common stock. Typically, the ratio at which this occurs is one to one at the start, but it can vary.However, in the event of a down round that triggers antidilution protections, this conversion ratio changes. How it changes depends on the type of antidilution clause written into an investor agreement, which we’ll discuss next.In the case of Internet of Wings, the company will adjust the conversion price of its shares in the event of a down round. IoW negotiated “Pay to Play” provisions with each investor as a defensive measure. If previous investors don’t participate in the next round, Series C, they cede their antidilution protections.Although these terms are presented from most common to least common, here we’ll approach them in reverse order because it’s easier to explain that way.No price-based antidilution protectionIt’s sometimes the case that the easiest way to explain how something works is to show what happens when it isn’t there. In our case, without any antidilution provisions in place, an investor bears the full risk of having their proportional stake in a company reduced, on an unconverted basis, in the event of a down round.If the investor holds preferred shares without an antidilution provision, their shares will be diluted at the same rate as common shareholders, like pro rata but in the wrong direction. On one hand, this may feel fair and equitable to the founders, employees and other common stockholders — because during a down round their investor is feeling the same dilutionary pain they are. However, to the investor a loss of relative influence within a company can, ahem, throw a wrench in their strategy.For various reasons, Provident Capital didn’t participate in this round. Due to the Pay to Play provision, it’s not eligible to receive antidilution protection for its Series B investment. Its Series B shares will convert to common stock at a price of $1.818, the same price paid at the Series B round.Full ratchetMath-wise, this is the simplest version of antidilution provision to understand.According to the NVCA’s model term sheet, full ratchet antidilution means that during a down round, “the conversion price [of preferred shares from the previous round] will be reduced to the price at which the new shares are issued.”Although BlackBox Capital’s Series B shares were originally issued at $1.818, and would have converted to common stock at that same price had IoW’s valuation not declined, BlackBox Capital’s Series B shares will now convert at the same price as the company’s Series C shares: $1.091. This allows BlackBox to receive 66 percent more common shares during the conversion of its Series B preferred shares. This 1.666x conversion ratio is derived by dividing the original issuing price of the stock ($1.818) by its adjusted price ($1.091) given to it because of the antidilution provisions.Typical broad-based antidilutionWeighted average antidilution, unlike full ratchet protections, take into account a number of different factors to produce a more “fair” or reasonable dilution regime. It strikes a balance between the amount of money previously raised (and at what price) and the amount of money being raised in a down round (as well as the new, lower share price).The NVCA’s sample term sheet includes a formula for the most common type of weighted average antidilution, a so-called broad-based weighted average.Here’s the formula:CP2 = CP1 * (A+B) / (A+C)Now, for Cormorant Ventures, in order to find the conversion price of its Series B shares, we have to solve this formula for CP2, the new conversion price.It’s not that scary. We already know these numbers, but they’re hiding behind some difficult legal language. Here’s how it translates in simpler terms catered to this specific case:CP2 = the Conversion Price in effect for Series B shares after Series C round is done. We have to solve for this.CP1 = the original Conversion Price for Series B shares. Series B shares were issued at $1.818 and would have converted to common stock on a one-to-one basis.A = the number of shares outstanding at Series B. There were exactly 27,499,998 shares outstanding prior to Series B.B = “The aggregate consideration received by the corporation” (i.e. the total amount of money invested in the Internet of Wings at Series C) divided by the original conversion price for Series B shares. Cormorant ventures is investing $6 million at Series C, and the original Series B conversion price was $1.818. B here equals $3,300,330.C = The number of shares being issued at Series C. As we discussed, there are a total of 9,165,902 shares being issued.If we plug all those numbers into the equation and solve for CP2, we find that Cormorant Ventures’ Series B shares will now convert at $1.527. This is a 16 percent decrease from the original conversion price.We can see here how the weighted average approach can seem fairer to both common shareholders (founders and employees, mostly) and other investors. Had Cormorant Ventures insisted on full ratchet protection, the firm would have been entitled to purchase shares at a much lower price, which would have resulted in a higher conversion ratio for them. Like we saw above, BlackBox’s conversion ratio was 1.666x. However, the conversion ratio for Cormorant Ventures is 1.191x. This weighted average method leaves more value on the table for both founders and other investors.Share breakdown after Series CIn the Series C deal, $10 million was invested at a pre-money valuation of $30 million. With a share price of $1.091, the company is now valued at just a smidge over $40 million, with 36,665,900 shares outstanding.In the past, we haven’t included a conversion price in our capitalization tables because preferred shares would convert to common shares on a one-to-one basis. But because IoW has now experienced a down round, this parity is now broken and we’ll have to include the conversion price. This also gives us the opportunity to calculate Internet of Wings’s ownership on an as-converted basis.Here’s how it all breaks down now. Here is the capitalization table of the company presented as-is, without any conversions:And here’s that same capitalization table, this time with ownership presented on a fully diluted basis:Note how Cormorant Ventures’ stake in IoW’s Series B round went from 15 percent to 16.8 percent because of the weighted average antidilution provision. But we can really see the power of a full ratchet clause when we compare the unconverted Series B investment by BlackBox Capital to its fully diluted value. BlackBox’s stake 5.25 percent Series B preferred stake jumped to an 8.22 percent stake due to its full ratchet antidilution protection.Here’s how the ownership of the company is divided by shareholder. Again, to show the difference between undiluted and fully diluted stakes, we’ve presented both here:And here’s the company’s share structure — presented on an as-converted basis — after the Series C round is complete:What we learnedIn this installment of A Startup Takes Flight, we followed our co-founders through the trials and tribulations of raising a down round. Throughout this part of the funding process, we learned about the two main forms of antidilution protections: broad-based weighted average and full ratchet clauses. We also saw how Pay to Play provisions can protect founders from antidilution protections by exempting investors who don’t participate in down rounds.Now, as we approach the final chapter, we ask ourselves how this is all going to turn out for Jill and Jack. Will their company rally and become a booming success and go public? Or will the looming threat of a corporate giant entering the ring force an early exit from the company?

When phones talk to each other using BTC or other currencies — whether it’s to pay bills or send money to friends — you open up an interesting world of commerce.Finney is a new $999 phone by the makers of the Solarin secure phone that aims to offer a “ultra-secure blockchain-enabled environment, with the functionality and essentials of Android OS.” Further, the company intends to release a desktop computer for $799 with the same features. In short, this is the world’s first proper bitphone.In order to maintain true crypto bona fides, Sirin Labs is holding a token sale that will allow only token holders to buy the phone, thus futzing with the phone’s demand curve and allowing users to trade in the Finney’s own currency.The phone will have a 5.2-inch display, 256GB of storage and 8GB RAM. It will have a 16-megapixel rear camera and a 12-megapixel front camera. Further, the phones “will form an independent blockchain network, a distributed ledger that is scalable and lightweight, powered by the IOTA’s Tangle technology.” The phone is named after Bitcoin pioneer Hal Finney, who died in 2014.The built-in wallet will have physical authentication, including three factors of authentication and secure resource sharing among phones. There also will be an app store for decentralized apps.Whether or not the Finney is a simple receptacle for crypto buzzwords or a real unique product remains to be seen, but it certainly seems like Sirin is pushing all the right buttons when it comes to making one of the first real bitphones. Hopefully things work out batter for the Finney than they did for Solarin.",The makers of the Solarin secure cellie are building a bitphone,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/the-makers-of-the-solarin-secure-cellie-are-building-a-bitphone/,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/2017_9_18-finneym-1050.png,technology,us,"TechCrunch is a leading technology media property, dedicated to obsessively profiling startups, reviewing new Internet products, and breaking tech news.",en,TechCrunch,['top'],https://techcrunch.com,"{'large': '', 'small': '', 'medium': ''}",21:18:01,2017,2017-09-27 00:00:00,2017-09-25 00:00:00,2017-09-01 00:00:00,2017-07-01 00:00:00

It doesn’t come as a huge surprise, then, that Google today announced a very similar move.Google Compute Engine, Container Engine, Cloud Dataproc, and App Engine’s flexible environment virtual machines (VMs) will now feature per-second billing, starting immediately (AWS users still have to wait until October 2). This new pricing scheme extends to preemptible machines and VMs that run premium operating systems, including Windows Server, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Enterprise Linux Server. With that, it one-ups AWS, which only offers per-second billing for basic Linux instances and not for Windows Server and other Linux distributions on its platform that currently feature a separate hourly charge.Like AWS, Google will charge for a minimum of one minute.It’s worth noting that Google already featured per-second billing for its Persistent Disks, GPUs and committed use discounts.While Google argues that, for most use cases, per-second billing will only result in very small billing changes, the company also notes there are plenty of applications where being able to quickly scale up and down makes a lot of sense (websites, mobile apps and data processing jobs, for example).“This is probably why we haven’t heard many customers asking for per-second,” Paul Nash, Group Product Manager for Compute Engine, writes in today’s announcement. “But, we don’t want to make you choose between your morning coffee and your core hours, so we’re pleased to bring per-second billing to your VMs, with a one-minute minimum.”So while Google doesn’t quite come out and say it, this is clearly a reaction to Amazon’s move, even though the company mostly sees it as another checkbox in a feature comparison between the two cloud computing services.So what about Microsoft?So far, Microsoft hasn’t made a similar move. “With Azure Container Instances we’ve actually led the way for per-second billing, with a service that spins up in seconds and spins down in seconds, we realized it was incredibly critical to give customers this granularity in costs,” Corey Sanders, Microsoft’s head of product for Azure Compute, told me at the Microsoft Ignite conference when I asked him about his company’s plans. “I’m excited to see other clouds follow suit and offer customers the best flexibility for their pricing.”As for regular virtual machines, Sanders stayed on message and noted that Microsoft wanted to focus on containers because it’s there that per-second billing makes the most sense. “We’re always looking to improve billing constructs across our platform and to make it easier and more agile for our customers to use,” he said. I’d be very surprised if Microsoft didn’t make a move to also check the per-second billing checkbox in the near future, though.","Following AWS, Google Compute Engine also moves to per-second billing",https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/following-aws-google-compute-engine-also-moves-to-per-second-billing/,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-480515891.jpg,technology,us,"TechCrunch is a leading technology media property, dedicated to obsessively profiling startups, reviewing new Internet products, and breaking tech news.",en,TechCrunch,['top'],https://techcrunch.com,"{'large': '', 'small': '', 'medium': ''}",21:08:09,2017,2017-09-27 00:00:00,2017-09-25 00:00:00,2017-09-01 00:00:00,2017-07-01 00:00:00

You shouldn’t have to — it should be impossible. That’s the intention of an update to the app that makes contact discovery even more private.It’s not that Signal or someone else was collecting this info to begin with — it’s encrypted the whole way, so really it’s already pretty safe. But say Signal were to be hacked or secretly taken over by the NSA. If this evil-twin Signal looked really closely, it could probably figure out who certain users were searching for monitoring for known hashes. That info could be used to de-anonymize users.Signal’s Moxie Marlinspike, who hinted at this upcoming feature at Disrupt last week, writes up the team’s approach to making sure that even that far-flung possibility is impossible.The technical details I’ll leave to him to explain for obvious reasons, but the gist is this: Conceivably, Signal’s servers could be surreptitiously logging every tiny action being taken, from which user info is being accessed to the exact location in memory where a response is written.Think of it like this: Even if what someone is reading or writing is hidden from you, if you watch closely you can tell where the pencil is and what movements it’s making. If you know the list is alphabetical, and that the first name is X letters long, that narrows it down considerably.This kind of ultra-low-level attack, on the level of RAM monitoring and so on, has to be considered or you risk underestimating your adversary.Fortunately, fast becoming a standard in chips is a “secure enclave” that can perform certain operations or store certain data that’s inaccessible to the rest of the OS. Apple has one for Touch ID and Face ID, for instance, so the rest of the OS never sees your biometric information — and therefore can’t give it up to hackers or three-letter agencies.By using this enclave and carefully manicuring its technique in querying the main database, Marlinspike and the team made it possible for users to check their address book against the main Signal list without anyone but the users themselves seeing the list or results. The enclave also checks to make sure Signal’s servers are running the code they’re supposed to be.There are still a few opportunities for this hypothetical evil Signal to snoop, but they’re decidedly limited — much more so than before. That reduces the amount of trust you have to place in them — though you still need to trust the secure enclave, the encryption method, and so on. But the fewer links in the trust chain, the better.This feature hasn’t rolled out to everyone yet; it’s still a “beta technology preview,” but is planned to roll out after testing in the next couple of months.","Signal update keeps your address book secret, keeps it safe",https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/signal-update-keeps-your-address-book-secret-keeps-it-safe/,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/gettyimages-597887642.jpg,technology,us,"TechCrunch is a leading technology media property, dedicated to obsessively profiling startups, reviewing new Internet products, and breaking tech news.",en,TechCrunch,['top'],https://techcrunch.com,"{'large': '', 'small': '', 'medium': ''}",21:05:35,2017,2017-09-27 00:00:00,2017-09-25 00:00:00,2017-09-01 00:00:00,2017-07-01 00:00:00
4363,4983,Sarah Perez,2017-09-26 21:00:06,"Twitter for the first time is expanding beyond its 140-character limit, the company announced today.

The social network says it will now try out a longer limit of 280 characters in select languages, including English, in order to allow people to share their expanded thoughts without running out of room to tweet.The feature will initially be made available to a small group of users for the time being, as the expansion is considered more of a test than a large, public rollout for now.The company says that it came to the decision to expand the character count because it realized the character count limitation more heavily impacted those tweeting in some languages — like English, Spanish, Portuguese or French — as compared with others, like Japanese, Korean and Chinese.twitter characters140 characters (left); 280 characters (right)twitter languagesAs the company explains via a blog post, the latter group could convey about double the amount of information in one character, compared with the former. Twitter then studied what that meant, in terms of tweet length in various regions, and found that only 0.4 percent of tweets in Japanese have 140 characters, but a larger (9) percent of English tweets did.It also found that most Japanese tweets are 15 characters on average, compared with 34 characters for most English-language tweets.Because of this, the new, 280-character limit will only roll out to those languages affected by “cramming,” which Twitter says is all languages except Japanese, Chinese and Korean.The change is a notable move for the social network, whose users for years have been debating the merits of an expanded character count.While some have argued that doing so would make Twitter feel less restrictive and more likely to encourage longer conversations, others have said that Twitter’s focus on brevity is its biggest differentiator, and, in fact, the very essence of its service.In more recent months, however, the company has started to distance itself from the 140-character limit — a move it made because the service is now regularly used to share posts that extend beyond just text. With Twitter’s ability to host photos, GIFs, polls, video and quoted tweets, it needed a way to allow users to both post media and their thoughts, all in the same tweet.New Twitter compose screen no longer shows character countAlongside this change, Twitter is also updating the user interface so it no longer counts down the characters until you near the end. Instead, a circle will fill in as you approach the limit, and you won’t know how many characters you have left until only 20 remain (or 10 for Japanese, Chinese and Korean language users).As to why Twitter is finally dipping its toe in the water of a longer text limit at last, that answer is stated in Twitter’s announcement.“In all markets, when people don’t have to cram their thoughts into 140 characters and actually have some to spare, we see more people tweeting,” the company says.(A Twitter spokesperson clarified to us that this understanding is not the result of having already publicly beta tested the 280-character count, but rather its observations of how different language users tweet. That is, in markets where there’s more room to tweet, people tweet more.)Twitter product changes haven’t impacted growthThe big picture here is that Twitter hopes that by making its service less confounding to use — with things like arbitrary character limits on tweets — more people will use Twitter. And “more people” is something the social network needs right now, given its flat user growth and declines in revenue and its ad business.But at the end of the day, it may not be technical limitations or their removal that’s slowing Twitter’s growth. It’s the fact that, despite its efforts to crack down on abuse, many still see the social network as a too-public forum for attacks, trolling and other sorts of mistreatment. (This isn’t at all aided by Trump’s continued use of Twitter to broadly troll naysayers and make threats of war.)Beyond this, Twitter has struggled to police its platform in other ways — like handling the bot problem, for example, or making sure that ads from neo-Nazis don’t show up.It also has ignored a top product request from users for years: the ability to edit tweets. (But “never say never,” we’re told, when asked if this would ever arrive.)Twitter says the new 280-character count will initially be available to a small, randomized but representative group of Twitter users on iOS, Android and desktop web. The test is not expected to last long — only weeks — before Twitter plans to make a decision regarding a broader rollout.This is a small change, but a big move for us. 140 was an arbitrary choice based on the 160 character SMS limit. Proud of how thoughtful the team has been in solving a real problem people have when trying to tweet.

4365,4987,Andrew Hayward,2017-09-26 21:50:15,Ataribox is a high-powered fusillade against Nintendo's NES Classic,latest,2017-09-26T21:50:15.,0.9603867160524828,techradar,"Ataribox: Everything you need to know about Atari's comeback consoleAtaribox is a high-powered fusillade against Nintendo's NES ClassicSharesThe Atari name still carries a lot of cachet with video game fans, given the company's role in creating the home console market – but its last piece of new hardware, the 1993's Jaguar, was a massive flop.Since then, the Atari brand has changed hands multiple times, emerged from bankruptcy, and been used to market social games and online gambling.It's been a rough couple of decades for Atari. But that could all change if the Ataribox ends up being a huge hit.What is the Ataribox? It is Atari's hopeful comeback in the console world, promising both access to original Atari games along with new experiences, pairing the classic with the modern.But beyond that, there aren't a ton of concrete details: as of now, Atari is gradually teasing out images and information, claiming that they're trying to respond to feedback before fully revealing the device.Will this be an NES Classic-style smash that successfully mines nostalgia, or should we expect another Ouya-esque microconsole bomb that falls well short of expectations? We can't say for sure at this point, but here's everything we know so far.Cut to the chaseWhat is it? A new Atari console that plays old games and new ones too.How much will it cost? Estimates are between $250-300When does it come out? Spring 2018 is Atari's targetWhat's an Ataribox?Atari first teased the Ataribox back in June with a pretty lightweight website and a brief YouTube clip, and then finally spilled the beans back at E3. Atari CEO Fred Chesnais, who bought the company following its 2013 bankruptcy, told VentureBeat, ""We're back in the hardware business."" The article also claimed that the device would be ""based on PC technology.""It wasn't until July that we got a better sense of what to expect when an email blast to fans who subscribed to Atari's newsletter answered some questions: The Ataribox will be available in two models – one with a classic wood grain front, and another that's black and red – with a very slim, streamlined aesthetic that looks a bit like a cable box or streaming set-top box. Both versions share the same, smooth overall design, with ribbed lines and a raised back.Based on the photos, we can see that the Ataribox will have several modern ports in the back, including an HDMI output, four USB ports, and an Ethernet cable port for wired Internet access. It's also planned to support SD cards, as well. That could make it easy to bring games, media, and other content to your Ataribox, or perhaps help sustain a homebrew community. Or maybe it'll just provide expandable storage so that users can buy as much or as little as they need, rather than Atari packing the box itself with it.""Our objective is to create a new product that stays true to our heritage while appealing to both old and new fans of Atari,"" read the email.Inside the box, you'll see an AMD customized processor with Radeon Graphics technology powerful enough to run games like Minecraft and lightweight indie titles just as well as the other consoles can. It will also be able to run traditional Atari games – though it won't take much horsepower to run them.According to a press release sent out about the console in late September, all this hardware will help the console bring a full PC experience to the TV, including the ability to stream shows and movies, access applications (the console runs on a flavor of Linux), log onto social networks, browse the web and stream music.As far as what the controller looks like – whether it will be an Atari 2600 gamepad or something a bit more ... modern – we'll just have to wait and see.Which games will it play?Well, that's the big question. After all, what good is another console if it doesn't have great games to play on it? That was one of the most obvious problems with the Atari Jaguar, but that was more than two decades ago in a completely different era for gaming, not to mention on notoriously complex hardware that was difficult to develop for.Atari says that the Ataribox will run classic games – digitally, that is, whether they're built-in or downloadable (or both) –which makes a ton of sense. After all, the NES Classic was a big hit, selling out every time it hit stores and leaving a lot of fans desperate and wanting when Nintendo opted to stop producing the box. The upcoming SNES Classic seems like it'll be another smash, given how impossible it has been to secure a pre-order for the 16-bit throwback device.Atari owns the rights to more than 200 different video game properties, including Pong, Missile Command, Asteroids, and Centipede. For a better hint at what to expect from the company, just check out the Atari's Greatest Hits app for iOS and Android: it offers 100 classic Atari 2600 games that you can buy in small bundles, or you can unlock the entire library for $10.If the Ataribox is patterned more like the Ouya microconsole, then it could serve as a platform for new and experimental content of all kinds, especially from indie developers.Obviously, Atari isn't going to release a custom piece of hardware, sell a $10 pack of games for it, and call it a day. That why the company has also teased ""current content"" for the Ataribox. Will that mean appearances by other, more modern Atari franchises like Rollercoaster Tycoon, Test Drive, and Ghostbusters? That could mean ports of Atari games we've seen on mobile platforms and other consoles over the last couple decades, or even ported PC games.Maybe! But it could also mean brand new content.If the Ataribox is patterned more like the Ouya microconsole, then it could serve as a platform for new and experimental content of all kinds, especially from indie developers. That would seem to make a lot of sense, especially if the device ends up being powered by a low-end PC processor, or perhaps even Android with a mobile chip in the mix (despite the ""PC technology"" suggestion). But for now, it's all just speculation. We know nothing for certain.When will the Ataribox come out?Atari has been a bit vague around this topic but, so far, it looks like the company is targeting Spring 2018, depending on how well the console's Indiegogo goes.""We know you are hungry for more details; on specs, games, features, pricing, timing etc,"" read the company's July 2017 email to subscribers. ""We're not teasing you intentionally; we want to get this right, so we've opted to share things step by step as we bring Ataribox to life, and to listen closely to Atari community feedback as we do so.""But we do know one critical detail: the Ataribox will be crowdfunded. Atari doesn't seem to be quite as flush with cash it was back in its early glory days, plus the Ataribox is a huge risk and will require ample investment.This is obviously a bit of a double-edged sword: If the box gets all the funding it needs within a matter of days – it'll be clear that Atari has a potential success on their hands. If they don't, well, it could be an early death for a neat idea.It wouldn't make sense to crowdfund a device that's already manufactured and ready to hit retail. Also, the email said there were still decisions to be made ""in the months ahead.""But hopefully we will see it in 2018, then, or beyond. However, even if the console makes its way to the mass production stage, crowdfunded consoles haven't had a great run so far in terms of longevity: the Ouya ended up being a short-lived phenomenon that yielded rough launch hardware and few essential games you couldn't play elsewhere.

Three- and four-way configurations will continue being supported in compute and professional applications.”Monster nicheOf course, these sort of three or four GPU setups are very much a niche area for those who want to branch out into experimental monster rigs (with a monster cost), so the impact of this move will be minimal anyway.Plus there’s also the consideration that such multi-GPU configurations often suffer from diminishing gains, with performance varying widely according to the game in question (with sometimes very disappointing results given all the raw pixel-pushing power involved with a trio or more of graphics cards).This move brings AMD in line with Nvidia, which also only officially supports two-way SLI with its most recent Pascal-based (10-series) graphics cards – although three- or four-way configurations can still be used with certain benchmarks.Note that there is a caveat with both Nvidia and AMD cards, whereby more than a pair of GPUs can be used with DX12 games if the developer codes specifically for this. But that isn’t likely to happen with many titles, to say the least, given the points that we’ve already mentioned – namely that these sort of monster setups really are a highly niche pursuit.To sum up, three- or four-way multi-GPU PCs are now pretty much dead in both camps, save for show offs who want to blaze to the top of benchmarking charts, or hopeful types who believe that developers may just support their graphics card-stuffed rigs in whatever upcoming title they have on the boil.",AMD’s Radeon RX Vega now only supports two graphics cards for multi-GPU setups,http://www.techradar.com/news/amds-radeon-rx-vega-now-only-supports-two-graphics-cards-for-multi-gpu-setups,http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rU3vJ8kVQTqFsZaVyLPWzZ-1200-80.jpg,technology,us,"The latest technology news and reviews, covering computing, home entertainment systems, gadgets and more.",en,TechRadar,['top'],http://www.techradar.com,"{'large': '', 'small': '', 'medium': ''}",21:35:18,2017,2017-09-27 00:00:00,2017-09-25 00:00:00,2017-09-01 00:00:00,2017-07-01 00:00:00
4367,4989,Seth Macy,2017-09-26 21:31:00,Solid computer storage upgrades,latest,2017-09-26T21:31:00.,0.7220293724966622,techradar,"Best SSDs 2017: the top solid-state drives for your PCSolid computer storage upgradesSharesThere are few things that will increase computer performance as easily and as noticeably as an SSD. Loading times evaporate when compared to similarly-sized hard drives, and unlike hard drives, there are no mechanical parts to break down or wear out.The lack of mechanical parts makes SSDs lighter, smaller and exponentially faster than their hard drive counterparts, so they make excellent upgrades for laptops, by slicing down a few ounces and helping facilitate air-flow in desktop PCs.Solid-state drives have come a long way in terms of technology, and more importantly, price. Capacities continue to increase while prices drop. More recent advancements like PCIe interfaces make SSDs even faster. If you're looking to give your computer a kick in the pants, here are the best ways to do it.Best SSD: Samsung 960 EvoThe undisputed king of SSDsCapacity: 250GB/500GB/1TB | Interface: PCIe | Warranty: 3-yearsPCIe InterfaceVariety of sizesOff-putting price tagThis is the top SSD on the market, and with good reason. It's astonishingly fast, with up to 3200 MBps read and 1900 MBps write speeds. That's due to the PCIe interface, which allows light-years faster speeds than the already extremely quick SATA interface. On top of that, it's available with up to 1TB capacity. And it only requires 5.7 watts of power when active and a mere 1.2 watts when idle.Best gaming SSD: Kingston HyperX PredatorUp your game with this unbeatable SSDCapacity: 240GB/480GB/960GB | Interface: PCIe | Warranty: 3-yearsM.2 form factorAvailable half-height adapterCostlyKingston's HyperX line-up is aimed squarely at gamers. Its headsets are known for being much higher quality than their price might hint at, and HyperX customer support is excellent. Its line of SSDs for gaming computers come in an M.2 form factor, but are also available with a half-height adapter that plugs into your PCIe like any other expansion card.Best NVMe SSD: Samsung 960 ProMaximum performanceCapacity: 512GB/1TB/2TB | Interface: PCIe | Warranty: 3-yearsExcellent speedsAvailable up to 2TBWhopping price for the larger sizesThe NVMe standard is designed to maximize the strengths of solid-state drives, and the Samsung 960 Pro takes full advantage. With an M.2 form factor and ridiculous read speeds of up to 3500 MBps, these SSDs are already enticing, but the fact it's available as large as 2TB is incredible. All that storage doesn't come cheap, but if you need lots (and LOTS) of fast storage, it's definitely worth it.Best PCIe SSD: Toshiba OCZ RD400The most flexible SSD installCapacity: 128GB/256GB/512GB/1TB | Interface: PCIe | Warranty: 3-yearsLots of sizesFast read/writeNot all sizes available in all form factorsIf you're looking for plenty of options, the Toshiba OCZ RD400 series of drives come in 4 sizes and three different form factors: M.2, M.2 2280, and add-in card (AIC). Not all sizes are in all form factors, so if you're looking for a fast 1TB drive, make sure you have room in your computer case.Best M.2 SSD: WD Black PCIe SSDOne hardy SSDCapacity: 256GB/512GB | Interface: PCIe | Warranty: 5-yearsGreat warrantyGood priceLimited size choicesThis M.2 SSD from WD comes with a 5-year warranty and boasts some pretty excellent read/write times, up to 2050 MBps read and 800 write on the 512GB model. Great for installation or OS purposes, but unfortunately the available sizes don't leave a lot of flexibility as far as storage is concerned.Best SATA 3 SSD: WD Blue SSDGlobs of flash storage for lessCapacity: 250GB/500GB/1TB | Interface: SATA | Warranty: 3-yearsExcellent priceGood size selectionLimited by interfaceIf you want to save a few bucks, but don't want to sacrifice too much in the way of performance, the WD Blue SATA SSD is a great compromise. It nearly maxes out the bandwidth of the SATA 3 interface with its read/write speeds, and you can find the 1TB model in the wild for a pittance.Best U.2 SSD: Intel 750 SeriesWired for the futureCapacity: 400GB/800GB/1.2TB | Interface: PCIe | Warranty: 5-yearsGreat warranty periodHuge capacitiesNot as fast as some other PCIe drivesThe U.2 standard allows for bigger SSD capacities and uses your computer's PCIe x4 slot to send all that data back and forth. The Intel 750 series includes a cable so you can mount the drive in the bay on your case and still plug it into the PCIe slot on your motherboard.Best budget SSD: Crucial MX300The Crucial MX300 has so much going for it. Available in a slew of sizes and your choice of PCIe or SATA interfaces, this is a great SSD for the budget-minded builder or for upgrading. Though the M.2 version is only slightly more expensive than its 2.5-inch SATA counterpart, it doesn't really provide the performance jump to even justify the small price increase.Best endurance SSD: HP S700 ProTough for anything you throw at itCapacity: 128GB/256GB/512GB/1TB | Interface: SATA | Warranty: 3-yearsRuns foreverVariety of capacitiesRelatively slowIf you need an SSD that will last into your next computer, the HP S700 Pro has just what you need. Its life will far exceed its warranty, offering up 2 million hours of use and up to 650 terabytes written. This is one SSD that's in it for the long haul, but the SATA interface will slow things down somewhat in the read/write department, which technically helps it last even longer.Best SSD boot drive: MyDigitalSSD BPXAffordable and fastCapacity: 240GB/480GB | Interface: PCIe | Warranty: 5-yearsGood price to performanceExcellent warrantyRuns hotBooting from an SSD is a life changer. Seriously, if you're loading your OS from a hard drive, you're doing it wrong. The difference is night and day. This PCIe SSD from MyDigitalSSD is an excellent choice for booting up, with a good price and solid performance. It only goes up to 480GB, but if you're just using it to run your OS, that's way more than enough.",Best SSDs 2017: the top solid-state drives for your PC,http://www.techradar.com/news/best-solid-state-drives-ssds,http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d6ca14e67f825d92f5ffd7fffe61c516-1200-80.jpg,technology,us,"The latest technology news and reviews, covering computing, home entertainment systems, gadgets and more.",en,TechRadar,['top'],http://www.techradar.com,"{'large': '', 'small': '', 'medium': ''}",21:31:00,2017,2017-09-27 00:00:00,2017-09-25 00:00:00,2017-09-01 00:00:00,2017-07-01 00:00:00

Why? Well, for one, with LA Noire being re-released for VR, you don’t want to undermine Rockstar’s cult classic detective game with the use of a dinky pair of earbuds. Instead, it’s essential to use only the best gaming headset in order to be fully captivated by the investigative work of Cole Phelps.Neglecting all the unwritten rules of fashion, the ROG Centurion 7.1 is a spectacle to behold. Though it’s a living hellscape to set up, this gaming headset delivers both extreme looks and an unruly knack for emitting crystal clear sound waves. The Asus ROG Centurion 7.1 not only bolsters full-fledged surround sound passthrough for an external set of speakers, but its set of onboard amp controls give you complete power, even if there’s a steep learning curve.Quick and easy to set up using a wireless USB receiver that stores inside the headset for transportation, the Razer ManO'War is a user-friendly unit primed for surround-sound gaming. Sure, it's a little chunkier than most other headsets, but two soft leatherette ear cups make it comfortable to wear over extended periods. And, with Chroma RGB lighting customizable through Razer Synapse, it even looks snazzy to observers.The HyperX Cloud Alpha is the best-sounding gaming headset in its mid-range price bracket. Though it only offers stereo sound, audio is crisp and bass is unmistakably present in action scenes. That said its garish looks and gaming-specific sound profile prevent it from being as versatile as some of its competitors.Although it’s designed to be used for the Xbox One, Windows users can take solace in the fact that the Turtle Beach XO Three is compatible with any PC sporting a single jack for both mic input and headset output or a PC splitter cable. In spite of this minor caveat, the XO Three is a steal for the price, especially considering its use of 50mm sound drivers. What’s more, it even supports Windows Sonic for 3D surround sound.If you're more interested in the sounds coming out of your gaming headset rather than glowing LEDs, macro keys and other gratuitous extras, then the V-MODA Crossfade Wireless is the headset for you. Its stylish cans are a treat for the ears, booming with sound that's bass-heavy with fantastically crisp treble at the other end. Stepping out of the soundscape, the V-MODA Crossfade Wireless is comfy and spacious too, what with its memory foam earcups.We called the original Astro A50 a ""game-changing, experience-enhancing headset,"" and thankfully its wireless successor follows the ""if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it"" rule. Astro's latest headset does what it says on the tin and adds wireless connectivity to an already stellar package. Not only is it ready to rock with your PC, but with PS4, Xbox One and legacy consoles as well – a headset that’s robust and versatile.Following in the footsteps of the already impressive Siberia 800, the upgraded Sibera 840 is pro-Bluetooth, anti-lag and all about personalization. With the SteelSeries Engine 3 app, you can customize everything from equalizer settings to what you want shown on the OLED screen of the accompanying base unit. All of that is, of course, secondary to the Siberia 840's sound qualities which are nothing less than sublime.With VR headsets like the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift making their way into PC gamers' rooms, specially-designed audio headsets for virtual reality were bound to follow. The Turtle Beach 350 Stealth VR is one of the most flexible out there, featuring a generous amount of adjustability thanks to its sturdy headband which can fit over the top of VR headsets worn on even the biggest heads.Unlike some of its competitors, SteelSeries stresses subtlety in its headset designs. The Arctis continues this trend by flaunting sound quality and comfort over gaudy appearances. When you pop an Arctis on your head, the goal is for, say, your stream audience to see a professional environment rather than a Dorito stain on your chair. The customizable lighting gives you plenty of wiggle room, too, in case the whole monochrome look isn’t your thing.Arguably one of the most affordable gaming headsets available today, the HyperX Cloud Stinger is designed to give players eSports quality audio at a bargain. While the red on black plastic design isn’t much to write home about, this headset’s 50mm directional drivers grace it with superb stereo sound. That goes without mentioning the noise-cancelling mic, which aims to keep background noise from hindering your game sessions.More affordable than Sennheiser's flagship PC 373D while still packing an audible punch, the GSP 350 carries over that headset's stellar 7.1 Dolby surround sound and closed ear cup design. Brandishing a closed-back design and toting a noise-cancelling microphone that mutes breathing sounds by default, if you like the look of Sennheiser's flagship gaming headset but can't quite stomach the price, the GSP 350 is the “lite” version you’ve been holding out for.Logitech's flagship G933 Artemis Spectrum gaming headset can be recognized by its cup-mounted G-keys that provide handy shortcuts to performing actions in-game. And, if you're fed up of round ear-cups on headsets then you'll appreciate its large and comfortable ear-shaped ones. The multi-colored lighting strip running all the way down the ear-shaped cup is merely icing on the cake.Capable of exuding first-pumping bass that’s powerful without muddying the mix, the Corsair Void RGB is a near-perfect blend of style and function, letting you configure its lighting colors using Corsair's intuitive software and even make it dance in tandem with the company's K65 or K70 mechanical keyboards. Plus, the Corsair Void RGB bears a wireless range of up to 40 meters, making it a solid and affordable option for surround sound gaming.Here we have a no-frills headset with an upstanding build quality closely rivaling those which cost nearly double. Used by a number of eSports teams, Kingston’s HyperX Cloud Revolver’s large interchangeable memory foam cups help block out unwanted noise, and the retractable mic allows clear and distortion-free communication with teammates. With 53mm drivers designed for punchy mid-tones and pounding bass, this headset comes highly recommended.Aimed at PC and console gamers, using Turtle Beach's Elite Pro feels like sitting down at a command station and gearing up for war. This headset emanates gamer cred right down to the subtle orange ruler-type markings on the headset's automatically adjusting headband. That's down to Turtle Beach's 50mm NanoClear drivers, which do an especially great job of bringing you into the heart of the action in shooters.",15 best PC gaming headsets 2017,http://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/best-pc-gaming-headset-1322675,http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mDD53PbHRt2NsVKjCCxW37-1200-80.jpg,technology,us,"The latest technology news and reviews, covering computing, home entertainment systems, gadgets and more.",en,TechRadar,['top'],http://www.techradar.com,"{'large': '', 'small': '', 'medium': ''}",21:30:32,2017,2017-09-27 00:00:00,2017-09-25 00:00:00,2017-09-01 00:00:00,2017-07-01 00:00:00

If you’ve got a BMW to go along with it, you can pick it up sometime in 2018.Specifically, you’ll need to have a BMW 530e iPerformance as it’s the only car that’ll support it at first. After that, BMW will extend support for other iPerformance models that support the optional wireless charging kit, such as the 330e, the 740e, and the X5. The 530e is remarkable, though, for having the technology already built in and ready to go.Oh, and there’s another catch.

So strong is the appeal, in fact, that some formerly naysaying competitors and developers are rethinking their strategies.But Sony Interactive Entertainment president Andrew House just isn't buying into the hype. Speaking with Bloomberg (via IGN), House effectively killed any hopes that Sony might release a new version of its portable PlayStation Vita gaming device to compete with the Nintendo Switch.House claims that there ""was not a huge demand"" for the Vita outside of Japan and the rest of Asia, and he points to the ""lifestyle shift toward the dominance of smartphones"" as the determining factor.If you already have a game-capable device on you at all times, in other words, why bother lugging around another?Nintendo Switch in handheld modeThe Switch's popularity seems to counter that, you might say, but House doesn't think so. Instead, he believes the Switch has found success because of its fairly unique hybrid nature.""The Nintendo device is a hybrid device and that’s a different approach and strategy,"" House said. ""The folks at Nintendo have their strategy and that’s great.”House doesn't even believe the Switch has hurt Sony's sales; on the contrary, PlayStation sales appear to be on the uptick. So for now, at least, Sony will apparently focus its attentions on its existing systems and their associated devices.""We remain focused around a highly connected gaming experience and also coupled with having a great range of other entertainment experiences so you can reach multiple people on the big screen in the household,"" House said.",Sony has no plans to make a new PS Vita to compete with Nintendo Switch,http://www.techradar.com/news/sony-has-no-plans-to-make-a-new-ps-vita-to-compete-with-nintendo-switch,http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/20e272d7ad7e583b1900acaf9310ee87-1200-80.jpg,technology,us,"The latest technology news and reviews, covering computing, home entertainment systems, gadgets and more.",en,TechRadar,['top'],http://www.techradar.com,"{'large': '', 'small': '', 'medium': ''}",20:04:33,2017,2017-09-27 00:00:00,2017-09-25 00:00:00,2017-09-01 00:00:00,2017-07-01 00:00:00
4371,4993,Cat Ellis,2017-09-26 19:48:51,"Remain private online, wherever you are and whatever device you're using, with the best free VPN on Windows, Mac or Linux",latest,2017-09-26T19:48:51.,0.8889503373520629,techradar,"Here are the best free VPN services for September 2017A word of caution. Criminals have stepped up their efforts to infect internet users by masquerading their malware as innocent-looking applications, this is particularly true for mobile platforms where free VPN clients are particularly popular. So be wary of freshly launched VPN services or offers that are too good to be true (they usually aren't).Also bear in mind though that VPN services are as secure as the weakest link in your setup. So if your device has already been compromised with malware, using a VPN won't save you from being spied upon, however, antivirus solutions could.TunnelBear might have something of a cutesy design, but it's a serious free VPN. There are free and paid-for subscriptions to choose from. The only restriction with the free one is that you are limited to 500MB of traffic each month.That said, TunnelBear’s exclusive TechRadar plan offers a far more generous 5GB, 10 times the amount you get if you sign elsewhere.This isn't a huge amount, so you won’t be able to use TunnelBear all of the time without paying, but it's great for those times when you feel like you need a little extra protection.Performance is impressive and ease of use is second to none. In all likelihood you won’t need to change any of the default settings, and the automatic connection option should work fine, but you can manually choose from one of 20 countries as your adopted location. Delightfully simple and reassuringly secure, TunnelBear is certainly one of the best free VPN's for all your devices.It’s also interesting to note that TunnelBear recently tuned up its privacy policy, so the VPN now collects even less data on users – removing the need to supply a first name to sign up, and ditching its record of the user’s number of total lifetime connections.Windscribe is a relative newcomer to the free VPN scene, but its generous data allowance and commitment to protecting your privacy make it the best around. The free service gives you 10GB bandwidth per month as standard, and lets you choose from eight remote server locations.You only need to create a username and password to sign up (an email address is optional, but might prove handy if you forget your password). Windscribe doesn’t store connection logs, IP stamps, or visited sites; when you’re actively connected to a server it stores your username, the VPN server you’re connected to and the amount of data transferred, but this is erased within three minutes of the session ending.The 10GB data allowance is enough to make Windscribe’s free service a practical option for everyday browsing (though not heavy downloading or streaming), and there are several ways to boost it even higher.Tweeting about the service will earn you an extra 5GB, and you’ll get 1GB each time you invite a friend to join. As an added perk, if anyone you’ve referred decides to upgrade to a Pro subscription (starting at US$7.50 per month billed annually), you’ll get the unlimited plan as well and far more servers (47 in total).If that isn’t enough to tempt you, there’s even a built-in adblocker and firewall. Give it a try today – we think you’ll be impressed. Note that there is an Android App available, albeit in an unreleased state at the time of writing.Hotspot Shield Free is one of the better known names in this roundup, and another of the best free VPNs around today.You can choose to anchor yourself to one of 20 countries if you pay for the Elite version of the app, and this should enable you to access just about anything you want; in the free version, you're limited to locations that Hotspot Shield chooses for you.Hotspot Shield Free offers the option to have the free VPN automatically enabled whenever you connect to a wireless network that is deemed 'unsafe', the program offers peace of mind for those who work away from the home or office a lot. Online performance does seem to suffer a little when Hotspot Shield is enabled, but the bandwidth limit of 750MB per day is generous.Note: Hotspot Shield’s free VPN offering has recently come under fire from the Center for Democracy & Technology, a pro-privacy non-profit organisation. The CDT has claimed that this provider intercepts and redirects traffic to partner websites which include online advertising firms. Hotspot Shield has denied these allegations and said that it was “dismayed that the CDT did not contact us to discuss their concerns”. Check here for the full lowdown on this controversy.The latest we’ve heard is a clarification which comes via Ars Technica, in which a spokesman for Hotspot Shield noted: “The free version of our Hotspot Shield solution openly and clearly states that it is funded by ads, however, we intercept no traffic with neither the free nor the premium version of our solutions. Our users’ online privacy has always been our absolute priority.”Speedify, as the name suggests, has one main aim as a VPN provider: to ensure that while you benefit from encryption, your internet connection remains as speedy as possible.To that end, the service will make use of all available internet connections to get the best possible performance, potentially combining, say, an Ethernet connection (fixed broadband) with a tethered mobile 3G/4G connection. Even if you only have one type of internet connection, the firm claims its turbocharging technology will still help speed things up.As well as the promise of better performance, Speedify operates a clear no logging policy, meaning it doesn’t monitor your internet traffic. And it offers clients for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android, and access to over 30 VPN servers.The free plan boasts full access to those servers (just as with the subscription options), the only restriction of the free offering being that you’re limited in the amount of data you can download.Free users get 4GB of data for the first month, but that drops to 1GB during subsequent months. That’s not a massive amount, and certainly not as much as some other rivals you’ll see elsewhere on this page, but it’s still enough for some basic surfing and email duties.And this VPN provider is definitely worth a look on the performance front, as during our testing, the aforementioned speed-granting technologies did actually prove themselves to have a positive effect.Like some of the other tools featured in this roundup, PrivateTunnel is available for a number of platforms – specifically Windows, Mac, Android and iOS. Another characteristic shared with many of its contemporaries is the existence of a limited, free package in addition to paid-for subscriptions. Well, sort of. Rather than offering a traditional monthly subscription package, you are instead provided with 200MB of non-expiring data to use as you want.When this runs out, you can purchase more data in bundles of 20GB or 100GB. If you feel that you'd like to use PrivateTunnel all the time, you can opt for a $30 per year package which give you unlimited data – see the 200MB as something of a taster session to see if you like everything.As a VPN, PrivateTunnel works fairly well, although connections can be a little temperamental at times. It's all very easy to use, so there's little reason not to take it for a test drive.The installation of Freelan is a little disconcerting for the uninitiated.

4373,4995,Gabe Carey,2017-09-26 17:19:00,Making the case for the best PC cases,latest,2017-09-26T17:19:00.,0.3671095039698137,techradar,"Best PC cases 2017: top cases for your desktop computerMaking the case for the best PC casesSharesWhen you’re building a computer, opting for one of the best PC cases is usually the last thing on your mind. Instead, it’s tempting to merely settle for a desktop chassis that’s cheap and fragile instead. Unfortunately, though, when that shell inevitably cracks, migrating all of your components over to a new home is all but an effortless procedure.That’s why, from the get-go, you should start out with one of the best PC cases on the market. And, luckily, we’ve taken care of the heavy lifting for you. That’s right, whether you plan on using your PC to play games, watch movies, create art or simply write like us, we’ve sifted through every computer case we could get our hands on to bring you only the best.Although your gut may have you certain that we’re lying, don’t confuse hunger for suspicion, as we’ve sniffed out 8 unique PC cases – each in different categories – that present a collection of compelling arguments for why they should be the one to house your motherboard. Better yet, these cases won’t break the bank either, as they exercise value as much as function.If you have an inkling that our list may be outdated for including this familiar-looking case, we don’t blame you for the suspicion. The Cooler Master Cosmos II 25th Anniversary Edition was designed to resemble the 2012 chassis of its namesake to – of course– celebrate its 25th Anniversary. The 2017 version optimizes HDD installations with its signature X-Dock, and its tempered glass side panel looks beautiful while illuminated by its blue LEDs.Finding any other PC case even remotely similar to Fractal Design’s Meshify-C is rare at the very least. Given that the entire front of the chassis is comprised of mesh material divided up into numerous polygonal shapes, the Meshify-C boasts quite the look, and it does so without compromising on function. With two fans pre-installed, interior cooling is (forgive us) a breeze, even if the Meshify-C is set back by a handful of stumbles.As its unit name suggests, the Nanoxia Deep Silence 4 was molded with the sole intent of being silent as a mouse. This silence-focused case is a well-rounded Micro ATX case that’s affordably priced and even supports some of the largest, most powerful graphics cards with its spacious interior. The fact that you’ll rarely hear it go above 30 decibels is merely icing on the very reserved cake.Micro ATX may have been around longer, but Mini-ITX technology is getting to that point where it’s finally viable for PC power users and gamers alike. The issue that Mini ITX cases still need to surmount, however, is the limitation they inherently impose on cooling and power options. Luckily, the NZXT Manta was designed for your mightier components as well as tiny mobos. The nearly full-size design might put some people off, but we find that it’s more than reasonable for this bubble-shaped colossus of a chassis.When you first see it, the Phanteks Evolv Shift X looks more like a sound bar than a PC chassis, but this helps it disappear into any living room or studio setup. It’s versatile to the point that it looks natural placed under a TV just as it does atop a desk, next to an equally high-end monitor. While it’s only compatible with Mini-ITX motherboards, which seems silly given its size, the Phanteks Evolv Shift X offers tons of space for components and liquid-cooled loops. If this chassis is a little too large for your liking, there’s also the more manageable and smaller Phanteks Evolv Shift.Our second entry from Fractal Design, the Define R5 is yet another mid-tower chassis bearing lush aesthetics. The metallic and blue LED-lit front of the case is simple, yet elegant, and is complemented by noise dampening materials throughout its interior. Despite the removable ModuVent panels and drive trays not being tool-lessly accessible, the Fractal Design Define R5 is otherwise painless to build a computer inside of. Not only that, but it’s not as pricey as you might expect from a PC case with such a pretentious name either.When you’re trying to keep the cost of your build down, we recommend not going for the absolute cheapest PC case available. For the most part, cost cutting cases are deprived of proper ventilation and airflow, not to mention you’ll wind up buying your own fans and cable management supplies. The Corsair Carbide Spec-04, on the other hand, shows up even some of the more extravagant chassis. It does so with rubberized feet, a bundled LED fan and plenty of room to spare for additional fans and components.This one is for our Razer fans out there. While the green snake-embellished company doesn’t make its own PCs, it has partnered with a few OEMs in the past to add its signature green-infused flare to a handful of desktop PC cases. This includes the Atec Cube, a small form factor case that tailors to Mini-ITX motherboards and is shaped like an italic font (if it was reversed). Complete with lots of headroom, either for an initial build or later expansion, the Antec Cube is simultaneously compact enough to be taken anywhere.",Best PC cases 2017: top cases for your desktop computer,http://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/upgrades/best-pc-gaming-case-2011-8-reviewed-956650,http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9xTBfjYeT768Cadmz5AmAE-1200-80.jpg,technology,us,"The latest technology news and reviews, covering computing, home entertainment systems, gadgets and more.",en,TechRadar,['top'],http://www.techradar.com,"{'large': '', 'small': '', 'medium': ''}",17:19:00,2017,2017-09-27 00:00:00,2017-09-25 00:00:00,2017-09-01 00:00:00,2017-07-01 00:00:00

Keep reading to find out whether it succeeds at just that!All-in-ones aren’t your average PCs. They're every desktops with integrated displays, frequently complemented by a mix of laptop and desktop components. For these reasons and more, they've garnered an unfair reputation of being inferior to their full-on desktop counterparts.Let it be known, however, that all-in-ones have their advantages. These self-contained PC setups typically require less desk space than a desktop tower, monitor and all their accompanying accoutrements. At the same time, they don’t produce a nest of cables for guests to trip over.Because of the inherent convergence that an all-in-one boasts, PC makers can rethink their design strategies entirely, thereby resulting in more innovative efforts such as the Surface Studio. Ultimately, this only benefits us – the users.Below are the best all-in-ones handpicked and regularly updated in traditional TechRadar fashion.Resting atop an articulating stand, the Dell XPS 27 AIO comprises a massive 4K Ultra HD touchscreen display with a whopping sextet of ear-numbing speakers. Not only is it attractive, but it’s also top-notch when it comes to delivering powerful specs. Whether you’re making your own beats or vibing out to someone else’s; watching films or editing them yourself, the Dell XPS 27 should be at the top of your list when shopping around for a new PC.The first thing you should know about the Surface Studio is that it’s probably not for you. Unless you’re an executive at a design firm, the massive starting price is enough to turn most heads in the other direction. That said, we would argue that the Surface Studio is well worth the cost of admission. Versatile and forward-thinking, Microsoft’s all-in-one puts the iMac to shame by introducing an all-in-one that can not only replace your lingering desktop tower, but your Cintiq as well.The iMac has long been on the of the most affordable Macs you can get and it's also one of the cheapest way to get a 4K screen to boot. Starting at grand and just a few hundred bucks more for that 4K upgrade, the 21-inch iMac with 4K Retina display, is a hardy MacOS machine featuring similar specs as the 5K variant but at a lower cost. For the money, what more could you really ask for from an Apple computer?Not to be shown up by the 5K iMac or new Dell XPS AIO, HP has its own unique take on the all-in-one desktop. Though it also has all its components stored in its base like the Surface Studio, the HP Envy Curved All-in-One also adds in a booming speaker bar. Add in the ultra-wide curved screen and this is one of the best and most immersive PC for enjoying movies.While Apple's iMac with Retina 5K display is one of the most impressive all-in-ones around, its price places it out of the reach of most people. However, if you're up for the expense there's no greater MacOS machine than this -- that is until the iMac Pro arrives. It comes with Apple's sharpest 27-inch 5K Retina display. Excellent build quality and hardy specs, also makes it a PC built to last, and a fine option for productivity work, watching movies or light gaming.",Best all-in-one PCs 2017: top compact AIO desktops,http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/pc/best-all-in-one-pc-the-top-one-box-windows-8-pcs-compared-1174017,http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/805b46e9468d5f258ed39da81d3c4674-1200-80.jpg,technology,us,"The latest technology news and reviews, covering computing, home entertainment systems, gadgets and more.",en,TechRadar,['top'],http://www.techradar.com,"{'large': '', 'small': '', 'medium': ''}",17:19:00,2017,2017-09-27 00:00:00,2017-09-25 00:00:00,2017-09-01 00:00:00,2017-07-01 00:00:00

California governor Jerry Brown is reportedly considering a ban on combustion engines.Last year alone two million new vehicles were registered in the golden state, any such ban would likely force American automakers to comply with timelines set forth by Brown. If California chose to enact a specific date by which manufacturers had to comply it could prompt other states to enact similar measures.According to the report Brown was prompted to wonder why California wasn’t already pushing towards a ban on combustion engines when he learned of a similar initiative in China.The Chinese government announced that it would effectively ban combustion engines in time, though it didn’t give any specifics on when that would happen. Also of note, concerning Chinese policy, is a Wall Street Journalarticle indicating that the country will soon relax specific rules requiring foreign automakers to work with a Chinese partner.These moves could leave the door open for companies like Tesla to open plants in China, effectively lowering costs for consumers – but potentially taking jobs and tax dollars out of the US.California has the opportunity to incentivize Tesla and other manufacturers to make their electric cars in the US by providing a drop-dead date for combustion engines.To reach the ambitious levels of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, we have to pretty much replace all combustion with some form of renewable energy by 2040 or 2050. We’re looking at that as a method of moving this discussion forward.It’s painful for some of us to try and imagine a world where the wide-open sound of a 1964 1/2 Ford Mustang’s engine as it tears through a quarter-mile has been banned.

It will run on Linux with a TV-friendly interface and use a custom AMD processor with Radeon graphics. The device will be able to run PC games and apps, browse the web and play music.According to VentureBeat, “the machine will run the kind of games that a mid-range PC can do today, but it won’t run Triple-A games that require high-end PC performance.” That’s a little confusing, considering plenty of mid-range PCs can run Triple-A titles as long as the settings are kept reasonably low. In any case, it sounds like it will be closer to the PS4 and Xbox One in power than the PS4 Pro or the One X.At first glance, the Ataribox seems highly reminiscent of Valve’s Steam Machines, which were meant to be relatively affordable PC/Console hybrids. Like Steam Machines, the Ataribox will run a Linux-based OS and feature mid-range components. Unfortunately, Steam Machines weren’t exactly super successful, though the Ataribox is at least aiming for a lower price point and has nostalgia to back it up.The company is aiming for fall Indiegogo campaign and a Spring 2018 launch.

And I can’t really blame them. What was once “the game,” swipe to your heart’s content, not worry if someone was out of your league, because, unless they also swiped right on you, it was a no harm, no foul situation. Of course, there were those that swiped right on everything to help bolster their self-esteem in the form of more matches, but generally speaking, this wasn’t a huge issue.Tinder Gold introduced a bunch of new features – some awesome, like being able to choose your location for those upcoming vacations, but some that are not as awesome and essentially eliminate what Tinder was all about.So, if you’re on the market for some new dating apps, I’ve compiled a list of some of the ones I’ve personally enjoyed using, as well as some that are just doing cool things for the online dating scene.BumbleA pretty straightforward dating app – you fill out your profile, upload some pictures, and start swiping locals in an range that you set up. It’s very similar to Tinder, but with one main difference – on Bumble women have to initiate the conversations. Matches go into your “Hive,” and until a conversation is started they just stay there.It’s not a huge difference to Tinder, you’re still going to get a lot of matches that just never talk to you, but it definitely adds an interesting dynamic. There is also the option to filter out by people that are only looking for new friends, making this a bit of a dual-purpose app.HilyAre you ready to let a machine serve up date recommendations? With Hily, machine learning is used to help offer up potential matches. You start as normally, filling in information about yourself and adding photos. You also have to complete a verification process which is supposed to really help cut down on the spam and fake accounts. While no system is perfect, bots have definitely been less of an issue on the platform.The magic starts once you begin really using the app. The more you swipe, the more you talk, and the frequency and depth in which you talk to matches is all data that is being crunched by uncaring machines in order to make better match suggestions for you. It’s an interesting concept, and like most things AI, it should just get better the more it is used.TastebudsThis one toes the line between dating app and social experience, but it is definitely something worth checking out if you’re really into music. Tastebuds will pull your music preferences from Facebook, while also giving you the chance to search and add music manually to your profile, as well. Like MySpace of yesteryear, you can even have a song on display that people can check out when looking at your profile.Tastebuds doesn’t have the largest audience, and you’ll have a much better experience with it in larger cities, but the concept alone is worth checking out if you’re a music lover.CloverIf you’re looking for a more well-rounded experience, Clover brings in many features from other dating apps and puts it under one roof. There’s an “on-demand” feature that lets you real dates with people. In addition to the normal matching features, it also curates local events, singles meet-ups, parties, and more.It also uses an advanced search feature that lets you fine tune your searches to help find your perfect match. While most of these features are available for free, it should be noted that some of the more advanced search options and verification process are locked behind a paywall.Online dating will always be an adventure, with everyone having their own goals and wants from the connections made online. While Tinder is still dominating, the new features with Gold have many looking for alternatives, and any of the choices listed above make fine candidates.This post is part of our contributor series.

The devices will ship with built-in resource-sharing capabilities and run on their own cryptocurrency token.The Finney smartphone and PC are being billed as niche` products, and with a price tag of $999 for the phone and $799 for the PC. After all, not everyone needs a secure e-wallet device that allows them to spend tokens on shared resources — but it would be really cool if we all had one.Moshe Hogeg, CEO and Founder of Sirin Labs, is a big-picture kind of person. The companies last device, the Solarin, was a $16,000 smartphone billed as the world’s most secure cell phone. It seems like the idea was to provide a solution for celebrities and secret agents who are willing to spend anything to keep their data safe.This time he’s building for the cryptocurrency market and, like many other startup CEOs, he’s betting on the blockchain.Hogeg told TNW:It will integrate a highly secure wallet for cryptocurrency cold-storage, to ensure security, and it also has a lot of blockchain technology. For example you can use the devices as a shared resource center. If you and I were travelling and I needed to charge my phone you could share your battery power with me in exchange for tokens. I could share my data plan with someone in exchange for tokens or become a hot-spot.While there’s no word yet on some specifics such as release date, Sirin Lab’s website does list the following technical specs for the Finney phone:5.2-inch QHD Display256GB of internal memory storage8GB RAMWi-Fi 802.11acBT 5.016MP Main camera12MP Wide-Angle selfie cameraAnd for the Finney PC:24-inch (diagonal) 2K DisplayBiometric security sensors8GB Memory256GB storageWi-Fi 802.11acThe technology behind the phone and PC will be released as open source. Hogeg told TNW that Sirin Labs will release the hardware designs as well, in hopes that other manufacturers will make unique offerings of their own. He envisions a plethora of devices being designed and created in places like Taiwan and Hong Kong, all operating on the same token: Sirin Lab’s own SRN.Sirin Labs will be launching its SRN token sale sometime in October, with early adopter bonuses and bounties. They’ll be accepting fiat money and popular cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and ETH. For the most part, this looks like your standard ICO launch. The distinction here is that token holders are the only people who will be given access to purchase the devices.It’s hard to picture a device geared toward the cryptocurrency crowd reaching the kinds of sales figures necessary to keep a $999 phone afloat, but how amazing would it be if we all started sharing our device’s resources?I look forward to living in a world where CPU power never goes to waste, data-plans are shared securely, and you don’t need an advanced IT degree to figure out how it all works together.The Finney represents a sincere attempt at empowering cryptocurrency holders with a device built for their specific needs.

In just a few years, it’s transformed the way people travel, and in the process ballooned into a multi-billion dollar company.But it’s also a fragmented market. Several compelling Airbnb rivals have emerged, like Flipkey and Homeaway. It’s common to see the same property listed across different sites, with differing prices and availability.One site that aims to bring sense to this landscape is Holidu, a German startup that uses computer vision and artificial intelligence to find and compare properties across the web.Unlike other comparison engines, it uses AI and computer vision technology to distinguish rentals based on the photos uploaded. Holidu is able to link properties, even if the photo is taken from different angles, or under different conditions.According to company founder Johannes Siebers, the inspiration came when he vacationed in Portugal in 2013. Siebers was looking for a property for himself and his brother, and was frustrated by how apartments were listed as available, but when he tried to book them, were actually already taken. This lead him to look into creating a comparison service, similar to Skyscanner.Here’s the problem. How do you compare apartment rentals? As Siebers explained, “Unlike in the flight markets, where flight IDs are a unique identifier for a flight, or the hotel market, where a hotel name and GPS coordinates are very good identifiers, there is no real other way to reliably find matches of houses on different sites”This lead Holidu to create its own image recognition AI, which Siebers claims has a 99 percent accuracy rate. “It not only recognizes ‘equal’ images,” he explained, but also identifies the room from different angles. The company also does manual recognition, for areas where there’s an element of doubt.The technology analyzes the similarity between the images of two properties that qualify to be a match, and in addition it takes other data points as the GPS coordinates of a property into consideration. We have then defined a certain threshold, under which we do not allow for automated matching, to make sure we avoid any false comparisons. The remaining properties are then confirmed in a very easy tool that looks a bit like a “hot or not”.The biggest challenge of this, Siebers explained, is that Holidu has a dataset consisting of 400 million images, and analysing it is a resource-intensive process.To make this less of a “needle-in-the-haystack” problem, it has partnered with a relatively limited number of rental providers — only 200. That sounds like a lot, but it’s worth remembering there are a lot of niche providers that target specific areas.For instance, in my hometown of Liverpool, there was briefly an Airbnb-alternative designed to bring tourists to the economically-deprived district of Anfield. While Airbnb is the biggest and most widely-known player, it’s by no means a monopoly.Holidu has experienced rapid growth over the past few years. Since its founding in 2014, it’s actively present in 20 countries, and has a catalogue of over seven million properties around the globe. Traffic wise, it attracts over five million visits per month.As the travel industry continues to pivot away from soulless chain hotels to the more intimate and personal experiences offered by Airbnb, it’s likely more people will head to comparison sites like Holidu to find better deals on apartment and home rentals.",This travel site taps AI for cheap vacation rentals,https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2017/09/26/this-travel-site-taps-ai-for-cheap-vacation-rentals/,https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/09/holidu-search-list-DE-social.png,technology,us,"The Next Web is one of the world’s largest online publications that delivers an international perspective on the latest news about Internet technology, business and culture.",en,The Next Web,['top'],http://thenextweb.com,"{'large': '', 'small': '', 'medium': ''}",19:44:51,2017,2017-09-27 00:00:00,2017-09-25 00:00:00,2017-09-01 00:00:00,2017-07-01 00:00:00
4537,6512,,2017-09-26 00:00:00,AR for social good shows the many apps that make social issues tangible in ways we’ve never been able to before. Here are some examples of using AR to further a cause.,latest,2017-09-26T00:00:00Z,0.8565951485659515,hacker-news,"AR for Good: How can Augmented Reality be used for social good?Ben MatthewsAugmented Reality (AR) mixes fantasy and reality by projecting an AR object over the real world. This allows you to see a mixture of real life and computer-generated life through your device.AR is similar to virtual reality (VR), but different. While VR aims to drop users into a convincing artificial world, AR enhances the real world by layering useful or entertaining computer-generated images over it.It’s a really exciting new medium and is being used for all sorts of entertainment, education and marketing purposes.For example, IKEA is using AR to allow customers to place furniture in their home before they buy it. Car makers like VW are close to launching cars with AR-enabled windscreens to help people navigate.Like many technologies in their infancy, the first iterations are rather basic but with the release of iOS 11 from Apple, with an AR Kit built in, we’re about to see more advanced uses of the technology made accessible to a much wider audience.While Pokemon Go (perhaps the best known example of AR) was used by some charities, AR can also be used to create innovative experiences for social good organisations. From interactive learning experiences, to fundraising, AR is a great way of making social issues tangible in ways we’ve never been able to before.Here are some examples of already using AR to further their cause: .Add to the arts“If you can’t go to the Louvre, AR brings the Louvre to you.”World-famous galleries contain some of the most beautiful and important art works ever created. But not everyone can afford to travel the world to experience seeing the art first-hand.Help with healthcareIn healthcare, AR could literally save lives.One of the cleverest applications has been ARnatomy’s use of the technology in medical education to enable students and teachers to pinpoint exactly types of bone, whilst also revealing relevant information about it on screen.This allows medical students to abandon heavy textbooks, and even better, manipulate a tangible skeletal model without ever having to meet a real patient.But it’s not just medical students who can benefit from AR. Vipaar is a service for practicing surgeons. Using AR a remote surgeon can project his hands onto the display of an on-site surgeon wearing AR enabled glasses. This enables them to point and guide the hands of the on-site surgeon, who may be less experienced in a particular type of surgery.And it’s already been put to use. A University of Alabama surgical team performed one of the first surgeries in conjunction with Google Glass, a wearable computer with an optical head-mounted display.AR even has applications for more every day procedures.For example, 40% of IVs miss on the first attempt at finding a vein, so a medical company called AccuVein have invented an AR scanner that projects over skin and shows nurses and doctors where various veins, valves and bifurcations are in a patient’s body.This has been used on more than 10 million patients so far, and made finding a vein on the first attempt 3.5x more likely. You could even see it make an appearance in your local doctor’s surgery in the near future!Help people see againMost of us will benefit from a different perspective provided to us by AR. But for some people it will literally change the way they see the world.Most people who are classified as legally blind actually retain some vision, but may not be able to pick out faces and obstacles, particularly in low light. Because of this, AR could make it easier for some people with sight impairment to explore their surroundings.VA-ST have built software that can be taught to recognise 3D objects and then identify them within a scene. When coupled with their SmartSpecs glasses, it provides a new way of enhancing vision for many people who are legally blind or partially sighted.For people with sight impairments, this can mean the confidence to find lost items, or navigate unusual environments.Source spots for solar panelsOur villages, towns and cities are full of roofs, just waiting to be turned into solar power stations. All we need to do to find them is Look Up!Made by 10:10, the carbon cutting campaign, Look Up harnesses smartphone tech to let anyone size up a roof for solar panels in seconds – no special knowledge required. You even get points for finding the best sites. It’s a bit like Pokémon Go, but for mapping your local area’s solar potential.Here’s how Look Up works:Find a roof that you think might look good with solar panels on and fire up the app to check it out.In two simple steps you can add the roof to the 10:10 treasure map. Then find out how much power it could produce by adding a few more details.Share your find on social media and climb up the leaderboard.By adding roofs to Look Up’s treasure map, users can help show the massive untapped potential for solar power in the UK, making the case for a renewable-powered future that bit stronger and the move towards it a little bit closer.Other uses of AR for social goodHere are a few other ideas of AR for social good that we’d love to see.See the supply chain: AR is perfectly suited for helping consumers decide what to buy. What if while you did your shopping you could see the inequity of a product’s supply chain, the environmental costs, the context behind each product? Would it change what you bought?Respond to emergencies: First responders, police and firefighters often arrive at chaotic scenes of emergencies and need to make sense of the environment and navigate a place they’ve never been. Could AR help by showing emergency services a virtual map of the emergency site, giving them “X-ray vision” to see underground water and power lines, avoiding potential danger?Promote understanding of mental health issues: If you think about it, AR is a lot like experiencing an hallucination. AR could be a good way of reducing misconceptions and increasing empathy for people who live with symptoms like psychosis.Have fun with fundraisers: Although we don’t think this has been officially released to the public yet, JustGiving’s Jonathan Waddingham was given early access to Facebook’s AR studio and used it to show us how AR could be used to help fundraisers celebrate when they reach their goals.",AR for Good: Can Augmented Reality be used for social good? | Montfort,https://montfort.io/ar-for-good-how-can-augmented-reality-be-used-for-social-good/,https://montfort.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/AR-for-Social-Good.png,technology,us,"Hacker News is a social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship.

4538,6514,Mike Hearn,2017-09-25 19:13:19,Design principles and an instantiation for a post webapp world,latest,2017-09-25T19:13:19.,0.0,hacker-news,"What should follow the web?Design principles and an instantiation for a post webapp worldIn part 1 of this series I argued that it’s time to start thinking about how to replace the web. The justifications are poor productivity and unfixable security problems.Some people felt that what I wrote was too negative, and didn’t recognise the web’s good points. That’s right: part one was “let’s discuss the idea that we’ve dug ourselves a big hole”, part two is “how do we design something better?” This is a huge topic so it will actually take more than two parts.Let’s call our competitor to the web, NewWeb (er, branding can come later). To start we must understand why the web became successful in the first place. The web out-competed other ways of writing apps that had far better tools for building graphical applications, so clearly it had some qualities that overwhelmed its flaws. If we can’t match those we’re doomed.Building a GUI with Matisse, a UI designer with automatic alignment and constraints. Long live the (newly stylish) King?We also need to focus on cheapness. The web has vast teams of full time developers building it. Much of their work is duplicated or thrown away, some of what they’ve created can be reused, and small amounts of new development might be possible … but by and large any NewWeb will have to be assembled out of bits of software that already exist. Beggars can’t be choosers.Here’s my personal list of the best 5 things about the web:Deployment & sandboxingShallow learning curve for users and developersEliminates the document / app dichotomyAdvanced styling and brandingOpen source and free to useThese aren’t exactly the most famous design principles: if you asked most developers to sum up the essence of the web’s architecture they’d probably say URLs, view source, cross platform, HTTP and so on. But those are just implementation details. The web didn’t take over from Delphi and Visual Basic because JavaScript rocked so much more. There were deeper reasons.The above things are pretty self explanatory. I’ll analyse them more as we go. To beat the web we must go further than just matching what it does well, we must also offer unique improvements the web cannot easily incorporate. Otherwise there’d be no point: we’d just work on making the web better instead.I offer two things in this text: some design principles I think any serious web competitor should follow, and a concrete instantiation cobbled together out of various open source projects. Many readers won’t like that concrete instantiation because they’ll have other projects or languages in mind they like better, and that’s fine. I don’t care. It’s just an illustration — really it’s the principles that matter. I name specific codebases only to show that dreaming is not totally unrealistic.Design principlesThe web lacks a coherent design philosophy, at least for the app parts. Here’s some things I think it should have but lacks:A clear notion of app identityA unified data representation from backend to frontendBinary protocols and APIsPlatform level user authenticationIDE oriented developmentComponents, modules and a great UI layout system — just like regular desktop or mobile development.It will also need the things the web does well: instant start of streaming apps with no installation or manual updates required, sandboxing of those apps, sophisticated UI styling, mix and match of “documenty” stuff with “appy” stuff (like being able to link to particular app views), a very incremental learning curve and a design that discourages developers from building UI that is too complicated.The first four items in bold are all security related. That’s because security issues are my motivation for taking such an extreme position. Perhaps the low productivity of the web could be fixed with yet another JavaScript framework — perhaps. But I don’t think security can. I’ll look the non-bold items in later parts.App identity and linkingTo get the deployment and sandboxing benefits of the web, some sort of app browser will be required. We’d also like the ability to treat parts of an app as if it were a hypertext document so we can link to things. That’s a key part of the web’s success — an Amazon search results page is sort of an app, but because we can link to it, it’s also sort of a document.But our app browser shouldn’t physically resemble a web browser. Look at it with fresh eyes: web browser UI is not excellent.The URL is a key part of the web’s design but it does make a mess sometimes!The first problem is that URLs leak all over the UI. The URL bar routinely holds random bits of browser memory encoded in a form that is difficult to understand for both humans and machines, leading to a parade of exploits. If a desktop app dumped random internal variables into the title bar we would rightly regard that as brand-destroying bugginess, so why do we tolerate it here?The second problem is that URLs are hard to read for machines too (mind blowing exploits available here). Even ignoring clever encoding tricks like those, the web has various ways to establish the identity of an app. Browsers need some notion of app identity for separating cookie jars and tracking granted permissions. This is an “origin”. The concept of a web origin evolved over time and is essentially impossible to describe. RFC 6454 tries, but as it admits:Over time, a number of technologies have converged on the web origin concept as a convenient unit of isolation. However, many technologies in use today, such as cookies [RFC6265], pre-date the modern web origin concept. These technologies often have different isolation units, leading to vulnerabilities.For example, ponder what stops your server setting a cookie on the .com domain. Now what about kamagaya.chiba.jp? (it’s not a website, it’s a section of the hierarchy like .com is!)Being able to unexpectedly link to parts of an app that don’t benefit from it and aren’t expecting it is one of the sources of the “dangerous link” problem. Heavily URL-oriented design makes all of your app subject to data injection by malicious third parties, a design constraint that’s proven near impossible to handle well, yet is blithely encouraged by the web’s architecture.Still, being able to link to the middle of an app from documents and vice-versa is pretty nice when it works and is expected by developers. Let’s take a couple of requirements:Requirement: app identity (isolation) must be simple and predictable.Requirement: we must be able to deep link into an app, but not always.To their credit, the Android designers recognised these requirements and came up with solutions. We can start there:App identity is defined by a public key. All apps signed by the same key share the same isolation domain. String parsing is not used to determine isolation.Apps can opt-in to receiving strongly typed packets of data that that ask them to open themselves with some state. Android calls this concept “intents”. Intents aren’t actually very strongly typed in Android, but they could have been. They can be used for internal navigation as well, but to allow linkage from some other app the intent must be published in the app’s manifest. By default, the app cannot be invoked via links.Where to find an app to download? A domain name is a good enough starting point. Whilst we could support HTTP[S] downloads too, ideally we’ll find a NewWeb server listening on a well known port and we can fetch the code from there. So a domain name becomes a starting point for getting the app, but is otherwise quite unimportant.To distinguish URLs and intents from our own take, let’s call them link packets.Requiring developers to opt-in to external linkage will lower the linkability of NewWeb in order to improve its security. Perhaps that is a poor tradeoff and will be fatal. But many links people can theoretically create on the web today are invisibly useless anyway due to authentication requirements, or because they don’t contain any useful state to begin with (many SPAs). And such apps would minimize their surface area for attack. The malicious link that is the starting point of so many exploits would immediately become less severe. That seems valuable.There are other benefits too — the importance of the domain name for webapps makes it tempting for domain providers to seize domains their executives personally disagree with. Whilst simple websites can be relocated without too much pain, more complex sites that may have established email reputations, OAuth tokens etc are more badly harmed. Private keys can be lost or stolen, but so can domain names. If you lose your private key at least it’s your own fault.As for the rest of the browser UI, it can probably be scrapped. Tabs could be useful, but reload should never be necessary and the back button can be provided by the app itself when it makes sense to do so, a la iOS.How to build the app browser? Even though NewWeb is pretty different to the web, the basic UI of fullscreen apps is OK and users will want to switch back and forth. So why not fork Chromium and add a new tab mode?(edit: some people are interpreting this as “use Chrome for everything that isn’t listed here” which isn’t what I meant. I meant re-using its tabbed UI implementation so you can have NewWeb and OldWeb apps open next to each other easily. But tabbed UI is not difficult and so there’s no requirement to involve Chromium, the app browser could be a from-scratch dedicated app too)A unified data representationMaybe the link packet concept sounded a bit vague. What is this thing? To define it more precisely we need data structures.The web has a variety of ways to do this but they’re all text based. To stress a point from my last article, text based protocols (not just JSON) have the fundamental flaw that buffer signalling is all ‘in band’, that is, to figure out where a piece of data ends you must read all of it looking for a particular character sequence. Those sequences may be legitimately a part of the data, so that means you also need an escaping mechanism. And then because these protocols are meant to be sorta human readable, or at least nerd readable, there are often odd corner cases to do with whitespace handling or Unicode canonicalisation that end up leading to exploits, like HTTP header splitting attacks.In the early days this might have helped the web catch on with developers. View source has definitely helped me out more times than I can count. But the average web pageis now over 2 megabytes in size, let alone web app. Even boring web pages of static text frequently involve masses of minified JavaScript that you need machine help to even begin to read. The benefits seem less than they once did.A primitive decompilerIn fairness, the web has in recent years been slowly moving away from text based protocols. HTTP/2 is binary. The much touted “WebAssembly” is a binary way to express code, although it doesn’t actually fix any of the problems I’ve been discussing. But still.Requirement: data serialisation should be automatic, typed, binary and consistent from data store to front end.Serialisation code is not only tedious to write but also a major attack surface. A good platform would handle it for you. Let’s define a toy syntax for expressing data structures:The web equivalent of this would be an amazon.com URL. It defines a immutable typed data structure to represent a request to open the app in some state.That data structure is marked with @PermazenType. What’s this all about?If we’re serious about being length prefixed, strongly typed and injection-free throughout the entire stack then we have to do something about SQL. The Structured Query Language is a friendly and well understood way to express sophisticated queries to a variety of stonkingly powerful database engines, so this is a pity. But, SQL is a text based API. Despite SQL injection being one of the easiest exploit types to understand and fix, it’s also one of the most common bugs in real websites. That’s no surprise: the most obvious way to use SQL in a web server will work fine but silently opens you up to being hacked. Parameterised queries help but are a bolt-on fix, which can’t be used in every situation. The tech stack creates a well disguised bear trap for us to fall into and our goal is to minimize the feature:bear ratio.SQL has some other issues. You quickly hit the object-relational mapping problem. The results of a SQL query can’t be natively sent over an HTTP connection or embedded into a web page, so there’s always some required transformation into another format. SQL hides the performance of the underlying queries from you. The backends are hard to scale. Schema changes often involve taking table locks, making them effectively un-deployable without triggering unacceptable downtime.NoSQL engines are not convincingly better: they typically fix one or two of these problems but at the cost of throwing out SQL’s solutions to the rest, meaning you’re often stuck with a solution that is different but not necessarily better. As a consequence the biggest companies like Google and Bloomberg have spent a lot of time researching how to make SQL databases scale (F1, ComDB2).Permazen is a new take on data storage that I find quite fascinating at the moment. Quoting the website:Permazen is a completely different way of looking at persistence programming. Instead of starting from the storage technology side, it starts from the programming language side, asking the simple question, “What are the issues that are inherent to persistence programming, regardless of programming language or database storage technology, and how can they be addressed at the language level in the simplest, most correct, and most language-natural way?”Permazen is a Java library, however, its design and techniques could be used in any platform or language. It requires a sorted key/value store of the kind that many cloud providers can supply (it can also use an RDBMS as a K/V store), but it does everything else inside the library. It doesn’t have tables or SQL. Instead it:Uses the collection operations of the host language to do unions and intersections (joins).Schemas are defined directly by classes, it does not require an object/relational mapping to be defined.Can do incremental schema evolution ‘just in time’, avoiding the need for table locks to change how data is represented in the data store.Transactions are precisely defined and copying data out of a transaction or back in is clearly controllable by the developer.Change monitoring, such that you can get callbacks when the underlying data changes, including across processes (if the underlying K/V store supports this, which they often do).There’s a CLI that lets you query and work with the data store (e.g. to force data migrations if you don’t want just-in-time migration), and a GUI.Really, you should just read the excellent white paper or read the slides (the slides use the old name for the library but it’s the same software). Permazen isn’t well known, but it’s the cleverest and slickest approach to integrating data storage tightly with an object oriented language that I’ve yet seen.One of the interesting things about Permazen is that you can use ‘snapshot transactions’ to serialise and deserialise an object graph. That snapshot even includes indexes, meaning you can stream data into local storage if memory is too small and do indexed queries over it. It should be clear how this can provide a unified form of data storage with offline sync support. Resolving conflicts can be done transactionally as all Permazen operations can be done inside a serialisable transaction (if you want a Google Docs like conflict-free experience that will require an operational transform library).NewWeb doesn’t have to use this sort of approach. You could use something a bit more traditional like protobufs, but then you need to use a special IDL which is equally inconvenient in all languages, and also tag your fields. You could use CBOR or ASN1. In my current project, Corda, we have built our own object serialisation engine that builds on AMQP/1.0 and in which messages are by default self describing, so given a binary packet you can always get back the schema — as such it can do a View Source feature, kinda like XML or JSON. AMQP is nice because it’s an open standard and the base type system is pretty good (e.g. it knows about dates and annotations).The point is that receiving data from potentially malicious sources is risky, so you want as few degrees of freedom in the format as possible and as many integrity checks as possible. All buffers should be length prefixed, so users can’t inject malicious data into a field to try and terminate it early. Data needs to be thoroughly checked as it’s loaded, so the best place to do that is in the type system and constructors of the data structures themselves — that way you can’t forget. Schemas help understand what the structure should be, making it harder for attackers to create type confusions.Despite the fully binary nature of the proposed scheme, a one-way transformation to text can be defined for debugging and learning purposes. In fact, Permazen does that too.Simplicity and learning curveOne problem with type systems is that they add complexity; they can feel like a lot of pointless bureaucracy to developers who aren’t used to them. And without tooling, binary protocols can be harder to learn and debug.Requirement: a shallow learning curveI’m convinced that a big part of the web’s success is because it’s essentially untyped — everything is just strings. Bad for security, productivity and maintainability but really good for the learning curve.One way this is being addressed in the web world is with gradually typed versions of JavaScript. That’s good and valuable research, but those dialects aren’t widely used and most new languages are at least somewhat strongly typed (Rust, Swift, Go, Kotlin, Ceylon, Idris …).Another way to address this might be with a clever IDE: if you let developers start out with untyped data structures (everything is defined as Any) the runtime can figure out what the underlying types seem to be, and feed them back into the tool. It can then offer to swap in better type annotations. If the developer seems to be encountering typecast errors as they work, the IDE can offer to relax the constraint back again.Of course, this gives less safety and maintainability than forcing the developer to really think about things up front, but even fairly weak heuristically determined types that only trigger errors at runtime can protect against a lot of exploits. Runtimes like the JVM and V8 already collect this sort of type information. In Java 9 there’s a new API that lets you control the VM at a low level (the JVMCI) which exposes this sort of profiling data — it’d be a lot easier to experiment with this type of tooling now.Languages and VMsTalking of which, what language should NewWeb use? Trick question of course: the platform shouldn’t be fussy.There have been many attempts to introduce non-JavaScript languages to the web over the years, but they all died trying to get consensus from browser vendors (mostly Mozilla). In fact the web has gone backwards over time in this regard — you used to be able to run Java, ActionScript, VBScript and more, but as browser vendors systematically erased plugins from the platform everything that wasn’t JavaScript got scrubbed out. That’s a shame. It could certainly use competition. It’s a sad indictment of the web platform that WebAssembly is the only effort to add a new web language, and that language is C … which I hope you don’t want to write web apps in! XSS is bad enough without adding double frees on top.It’s always easier to agree on problems than solutions, but never mind — it’s time to get (more) controversial. The core of my personal NewWeb design would be the JVM. This will not surprise those who know me. Why the JVM?HotSpot can run the largest variety of languages of any virtual machine, and the principle of cheapness dictates that we want to be able to use as much open source code as possible. Yes, that means I want to be able to make apps that include JavaScript (run at high speed), along with Ruby, Python, Haskell, and oh yes — C, C++ and Rust should come along for the ride too. All this is possible because of two really cool projects called Graal & Truffle, which I’ve written about extensively before. These projects let the JVM run even languages you wouldn’t expect (like Rust) in a virtualized, fast and interoperable way. I don’t know of any other VM that can blend so many languages together, so seamlessly, and with such good performance.The OpenJDK sandbox has been attacked relentlessly for years and has learned the same painful lessons that web browser makers have. The last zero day exploit was in 2015, and the one before that was in 2013. Just two sandbox 0-days in 5 years is good enough for me, especially because lessons have been learned from each exploit found and fundamental security improvements have been made over time. No sandbox has a perfect track record, so really this boils down to a personal judgement call — what level of security is good enough?There’s huge quantities of high quality libraries that solve key parts of the puzzle, like Permazen and JavaFX.I happen to know it quite well and I like Kotlin, which has a JVM backend.I expect lots of people to disagree with that choice. No problem — the same design ideas can be implemented on top of Python or V8 or Go or Haskell, or whatever else floats your boat. Best if you can pick something that has an open spec with competing implementations though (the JVM does).The politics of Oracle don’t concern me much because Java is open source. There aren’t a lot of high quality, high performance open source runtimes out there to choose from. The ones that do exist are all built by giant software firms who have all made their own questionable decisions in the past as well. The web has at various times been heavily influenced or outright controlled by Microsoft, Google, Mozilla and Apple. All of them have done things I found objectionable: that’s the nature of large companies. You won’t agree with their actions all the time. Oracle won’t win any popularity contests, but the nice thing about open source code is that it doesn’t really have to.There are a few things I’d want to reuse from Google Chrome specifically. My app browser should support an equivalent to WebGL (i.e. eGL), and Chromium’s ANGLE project would be useful for that. The app browser should silently auto update like Chrome does, and Google’s auto update engines are open source too. Finally, whilst the Pack200 format compresses bytecode by a lot, throwing in nice codecs like Zopfli wouldn’t hurt.RPCBinary data structures aren’t enough. We need binary protocols too. A standard way to link client with server is RPC.Returning large or infinitely sized byte streams (e.g. for live video).Flow control for high vs low priority transfers.Versioning, interface evolution, type checking.Again, in the Corda project we’ve tackled designing an RPC stack with these properties. It isn’t currently released as a standalone library but perhaps in future we’ll do that.HTTP/2 is one of the most recent and most designed parts of the web, and it’s a decent enough framing and transport protocol. But it inherits a lot of cruft from HTTP. Consider the hacks opened up by obscure HTTP methods that are never used. HTTP’s odd approach to state doesn’t help. HTTP itself is stateless, but apps need stateful sessions, so app devs have to add their own on top using a mishmash of easily stealable cookies, tokens and so on. This leads to problems like session fixation attacks.It’d be better to split things more clearly into layers:Encryption, authentication and session management. TLS does a decent job of this. We’d just reuse it.Transport and flow control. HTTP/2 does this, but messaging protocols like AMQP also do it, without the legacy.RPCThe RPC stack is obviously integrated with the data structure framework, so all transfers are typed. Developers never need to do any parsing by hand. RPC naming is just a simple string comparison. There are no path traversal vulnerabilities as a consequence.User authentication and sessionsNewWeb would not use cookies. It’s better to use a public/private keypair to identify a session. The web is heading in this direction, but to be compatible with existing web apps there has to be a complicated “binding” step where bearer tokens like cookies are connected to the underlying cryptographic session and that’s just needless complexity in a security sensitive component — it can be tossed in a clean redesign. Sessions are only ever identified on the server side by a public key.User authentication is one of the hardest bits of a web app to get right. I wrote down some thoughts on that previously so I won’t go deep on that again. Suffice it to say that linking a session to an email address is a feature best handled by the base platform and not constantly re-invented at the app layer. A client side TLS certificate is sufficient to implement a basic single sign-on system, with the basic ‘send email and sign certificate if received’ flow being so cheap that Lets Encrypt style free providers are not unthinkable.This approach builds on tech that already exists, but should make a serious dent in phishing, password database breaches, password guessing and many other related issues.ConclusionA platform that wants to compete with the web should have a strong focus on security, as that’s the primary justification and competitive advantage. It’s the main thing you can’t easily fix about the web. That means: binary, type safe data structures and APIs, RPC, cryptographic sessions and user identification.It also means code that’s sandboxed and streaming, UI that has great layout management yet is also responsive and styleable, some way to blend documents and apps together as well as the web does, and a very productive development environment.

4539,6518,Daisuke Wakabayashi,2017-09-27 00:06:30,The editorial head of a socialist website complained that Google is censoring the internet by curbing search traffic to his publication.,latest,2017-09-27T00:06:30Z,0.013787721123829344,hacker-news,"As Google Fights Fake News, Voices on the Margins Raise AlarmSAN FRANCISCO — When David North, the editorial chairman of the World Socialist Web Site, noticed a drop in the site’s traffic in April, he initially chalked it up to news fatigue over President Trump or a shift in political consciousness.But when he dug into the numbers, Mr. North said, he found a clearer explanation: Google had stopped redirecting search queries to the site. He discovered that the top search terms that once brought people to the World Socialist Web Site were now coming up empty.“This is not an accident,” Mr. North said. “This is some form of deliberate intervention.”Accusations that Google has tampered with search results are not uncommon and date back to the earliest days of its search engine. But they are taking on new life amid concerns that technology behemoths are directly — or indirectly — censoring controversial subjects in their response to concerns over so-called fake news and the 2016 presidential election.In April, Google announced an initiative called Project Owl to provide “algorithmic updates to surface more authoritative content” and stamp out fake news stories from its search results.“They’re really skating on thin ice,” said Michael Bertini, a search strategist at iQuanti, a digital marketing agency. “They’re controlling what users see. If Google is controlling what they deem to be fake news, I think that’s bias.”Despite Google’s insistence that its search algorithm undergoes a rigorous testing process to ensure that its results do not reflect political, gender, racial or ethnic bias, there is growing political support for regulating Google and other tech giants like public utilities and forcing it to disclose how exactly its arrives at search results.Most people have little understanding of how Google’s search engine ranks different sites, what it chooses to include or exclude, and how it picks the top results among hundreds of billions of pages. And Google tightly guards the mathematical equations behind it all — the rest of the world has to take their word that it is done in an unbiased manner.“The complexity of ranking and rating is always going to lead to some lack of understanding for people outside of the company,” said Frank Pasquale, an information law professor at the University of Maryland. “The problem is that a lot of people aren’t willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.” In his book, “The Black Box Society,” Mr. Pasquale warned about the potential risks from an overreliance on secret algorithms that control what information we see and how critical decisions are made.As the dominant search engine, with an estimated 90 percent global market share, Google was criticized by both the right and the left of the political world during the 2016 election.In June 2016, a video from the pop culture site SourceFed accused Google of manipulating automatically completed search suggestions to favor Hillary Clinton. Google denied the claim, but right-wing media seized on the video as an example that the company was tipping the scales in her favor.In the days after the election, the top Google search results for “final election vote count 2016” was a link to a story that wrongly stated that Mr. Trump, who won the Electoral College, had also defeated Mrs. Clinton in the popular vote.In the research that led to the creation of Project Owl, Google found that a small fraction of its search results — about 0.25 percent of daily traffic — were linking to intentionally misleading, false or offensive information. For a company that aims to deliver the most relevant information for all queries, that constituted a crisis.PhotoDavid North, editorial chairman of the World Socialist Web Site, in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.Credit Laura McDermott for The New York TimesGoogle said it had added more detailed examples of problematic pages into the guidelines used by human raters to determine what is a good search result and what is a bad one. Google said its global staff of more than 10,000 raters do not determine search rankings, but their judgments help inform how the algorithm performs in the future.Google has often said that it cannot reveal too much or people would use that information to try to game the rankings. The opacity around Google’s algorithm has given birth to a cottage industry of search engine optimization experts who dissect the company’s comments.To assuage criticism about that lack of transparency, Google made public its guidelines for search quality in 2013. Pandu Nayak, a Google fellow who focuses on search quality, said disclosing the guidelines is more meaningful.An error has occurred. Please try again later.You are already subscribed to this email.“The actual algorithm is not as important as what the algorithm is trying to do,” said Mr. Nayak. “Being completely transparent of what you’re trying to achieve is the central goal because how you accomplish that can change.”Google said hundreds of factors go into its search algorithm and the formula is also constantly evolving. The company said it conducted 150,000 search experiments and implemented 1,600 changes last year.This is why it’s hard to pinpoint exactly why search traffic plummets for a site like the World Socialist Web Site, which calls itself the “online newspaper of the international Trotskyist movement.” Mr. North, the site’s chairman, said traffic coming in from search is down 70 percent since April, citing data from Alexa, a web traffic analytics firm owned by Amazon.com.In an open letter to Google last month, Mr. North traced his site’s traffic decline to Project Owl. Mr. North said he believed that Google was blacklisting the site, using concerns over fake news as a cover to suppress opinions from socialist, antiwar or left-wing websites and block news that Google doesn’t want covered.In mid-April, a Google search for “socialism vs. capitalism” brought back one of the site’s links on the first results page but, by August, that same search didn’t feature any of its links. The site said 145 of the top 150 search terms that had redirected people to the site in April are now devoid of its links.“They should be asked to explain how they’re doing it,” Mr. North said. “If they say we’re not doing anything, that’s simply not credible.”Mr. North said that Google has not responded to his claims. Google declined to comment on the World Socialist Web Site.Mr. North argued the drop-off in traffic is the result of Google directing users toward mainstream media organizations, including The New York Times. The World Socialist Web Site claimed that search referral traffic had fallen since April at a variety of other left-wing, progressive, socialist or antiwar publications like AlterNet and Consortiumnews.The New York Times could not find the same level of traffic declines at all of those publications, based on data from SimilarWeb, a web analytics firm. Traffic coming from search engines for the World Socialist Web Site was down 34 percent during the months of May to July, compared with the preceding three months, according to SimilarWeb. Traffic that did not come from search was up 1 percent during the same period.Mr. North said his site provides critical analysis for current events and it has nothing in common with sites peddling blatantly untrue stories. But he said he is opposed to any actions taken by Google under the pretext of stopping fake news.“I’m against censorship in any form,” he said. “It’s up to people what they want to read. It’s not going to stop with the World Socialist Web Site. It’s going to expand and spread.”","As Google Fights Fake News, Voices on the Margins Raise Alarm",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/technology/google-search-bias-claims.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/27/business/27GOOGLE-1/27GOOGLE-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,technology,us,"Hacker News is a social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship.

For a business centered around facilitating extramarital hookups, you’d expect a certain amount of damage should user data ever become compromised.You’d expect a certain amount of risk to accompany stepping outside your marriage. But for many adulterers, the risk somehow seemed less so when a bulk of the communication happened — or at least started — online.But what about Tinder? It’s an app for hookups, or at least it started as one. But unlike Ashley Madison, which touted a slogan of “Life is short. Have an affair.,” Tinder is the mostly PG-13 version of hooking up online. It’s a platform to meet people, and while it’s often used for salacious reasons, it’s not positioned in the same way as the Adult Friend Finder’s or Ashley Madison’s of the world.Journalist Judith Duportail penned a piece in The Guardian that details what a Tinder breach could look like and, spoiler alert, it’ll be a lot worse than Ashley Madison.Under European Union data protection laws, citizens can request access to the personal data each company collects about them. Duportail used this law to gain access to the information stored by Tinder — a whopping 800 pages of data archiving everything from personal conversations, match data, and sexual preferences. Hiding in these pages was also freely shared, and not often thought about, data on everything from jobs, travel locations, interests, and what she liked to eat.Duportail, essentially, proved the concept of a 2017 study that showed Tinder users are prone to revealing excessive amounts of information, and all without realizing it.Luke Star, a digital technology sociologist at Dartmouth University told The Guardian:You are lured into giving away all this information. Apps such as Tinder are taking advantage of a simple emotional phenomenon; we can’t feel data. This is why seeing everything printed strikes you. We are physical creatures. We need materiality.If 800 pages of Tinder data on a single user hits home, imagine the dossier Facebook or Google has on you. But if there’s a bright spot in any of this, it’s that you live in 2017, where companies take data protection seriously.However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, chats, or other communications will always remain secure.

There are a number of updates that should appeal in the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, but the one question most upgraders are going to be asking is how good is the camera?The camera system in the iPhone is becoming the central focus of its technological advancements. And it’s not just about pictures anymore. With augmented reality and computer vision emerging as contenders for the next major wave in platform development, the camera system is an input mechanism, a communications system and a statement of intent.If the camera is a platform, the time to begin reviewing the iPhone as a camera is long overdue.Two years ago, in my review of the iPhone 6s, I noted that the pace of iPhone performance improvements had quickened. The in-between years of the ’s’ models of iPhone were becoming the times when big silicon releases were being injected into the devices. Huge leaps in processing power and efficiency in versions that were being discounted as iterations on the previous year’s models.The iPhone 8 proves to be an odd sort of proof for this hypothesis. Apple is launching it one year after the iPhone 7 while nearly simultaneously performing a table flip and announcing the iPhone X just minutes later. Gone is the ’s’ appendix, but continuing is the tradition of “ticking” the silicon improvements forward with crazy speed.I’ll get this part out of the way right at the top. My recommendation remains unchanged from last year: With nicely enhanced cameras, more power and a fresh look, these are easy phones to recommend if you’re open to an upgrade.But let’s dig a bit deeper.Back that glass upThe return of the glass back is going to be a love-it-or-hate-it feature of the iPhone 8. But for me, it’s a love it. Since I gave up my iPhone 4s, I’ve been missing that feel you get from having both sides of the phone coated in glass.There’s something about the texture of glass. It’s smoother than the aluminum, but typically less slippery and easier to grip. Glass also warms up to the temperature of your hand faster and stays at that temperature rather than getting hot. And when your phone is really chugging along, it distributes the heat from the processor better, making hot spots less pronounced.But the main reason for the glass coating isn’t any of that, it’s that it needs to be radio transparent to enable wireless charging. I don’t know the exact internal layout of the phone yet, we’ll have to wait for a teardown, but it’s likely to be a wire loop of some sort that acts as a power antenna. With an aluminum back, Apple would have had to resort to some sort of external antenna, and that was never likely to happen. As it is, you get a nice return to form in the service of function.So many iPhone screens get broken every year that making both sides glass seems inadvisable at best, but Apple has done a bit to help here.First, the company works directly with Corning to develop stronger glass. It then gets exclusive access to this glass for some time before any competitor can use it. This is where the ion exchange process Apple has been using in its glass came from. That layer of strengthening is now 50 percent deeper than before. Think of it as a layer of toughened skin like a callous on your finger.There’s also a bit more help in the shape of a substructure of copper and steel molecularly bonded together with a proprietary laser process and laid down in a lattice-style layer with gaps to allow things like wireless charging to take place through the back. Steel is strong and copper is a great heat sink. Together, hopefully, they make for a less breakable iPhone.The aluminum of the body has also been strengthened again, just as it was in the second revision of this frame in the iPhone 6s. So, theoretically, you’re looking at the toughest possible phone made out of glass you can find. For what that’s worth.The glass also allows for a beautifully translucent effect on the back of the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. Light traveling through the glass, off of the under coating and back gives it a layered look. It makes the back of the aluminum 7 models look positively pedestrian by comparison.For those interested, the Gold finish has a ton of pink in it. The backside is almost spot on ‘Millennial Pink’, that suddenly ubiquitous shade. I think it’s safe to say Apple thinks Rose Gold is on the outs (the fashion world agrees) and pink is in.In short it’s like this. From the front: real similar; from the side: real similar; from the back: new hotness.The best reason to buy a new iPhoneThe camera is the best reason to buy a new iPhone this year just as it has been several years running. The iPhone is the world’s most popular camera, by far, and Apple continues to take seriously the business of improving it.As I’ve mentioned before in these reviews, I have a lengthy history in photography. I’ve been a working pro photographer, and I’ve sold cameras, performed maintenance and run a print lab. This has helped me to recognize the difference between how seriously Apple takes photography and the way that other companies approach “making the camera better.”There are other smartphones that take excellent pictures, Samsung’s Galaxy S8+, the most direct competitor in terms of hardware that Apple has, among them. However, once you move beyond the basics of increasing resolution, basic optimization and adding catch-up computational features like faux blur, you begin to realize that there’s not a smartphone company on earth that takes it as far as Apple does. It’s just not comparable once you get into the nitty gritty. Here are a few examples you’ll find in the iPhone 8.Sensor improvements. Same resolution, 12MP, but bigger sensor overall. This is a great recipe for improved image quality. I’m a big fan of concentrating on the size of the individual image sensors that translate into larger individual pixels and making the walls between them deeper, both of which Apple has done here. Those deeper pixel wells give better isolation between capture elements so that you don’t get that speckle that results in color confusion between two pixels.There’s also a new color filter. Given that digital camera color filters haven’t changed much in years, I was curious about the details here, but couldn’t learn much more than that it should result in improved dynamic range and color.High dynamic range (HDR) shooting has also been massively improved, to the point where there is no longer even a toggle for it. You just shoot, and if the camera thinks your picture will benefit by an expansion of tones into dark and light it will use it. And there’s such a tiny lag in between the images used to composite together an HDR shot that you’ll find very little of that ghosting that happened under the previous system. You’ll notice that you no longer get two shots — one HDR and one not. That’s how confident Apple is. It’s really well done — seamless even.The wide and telephoto sensors in the 8 Plus have both been updated, and the system has 83 percent more throughput, which allows for more data to be passed through in a more power-efficient manner. This will help with rapid fire images, but more importantly it allows for the enormous amount of information that needs to be pushed through the pipeline to support 4K video at 60 frames per second and super slo-mo 1080p at 240 FPS.Apple’s adoption of the HEVC video format, which is enormously effective at reducing file sizes, assists with this, but that’s still crazy impressive. Especially given that Apple is not playing tricks with video quality, and that this still leaves plenty of overhead for the computer vision smarts it uses on video to determine subject matter.The results are better color with a wider range of tones across all kinds of shooting environments. Apple is particularly fond of their work capturing skies with the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, because skies are chock full of light of all spectrums. That holds up in my testing — less banding, more gradations of tone that reproduce more accurately.Textures in shooting cloth or any other fine detail up close are also improved, with less chance for muddy or moire images when the patterns are super regular. This is reflected in the 4K video modes as well, which have better color rendition across dark and light scenes and less artifacting.Though you don’t get it at a full 240 FPS yet, it may be interesting to some slow-motion videographers that you get continuous autofocus at 1080p 120 FPS now. This should help track subjects during a slo-mo shot as they move toward or away from you.Similarly, skin tones have been improved, with less heavy-handed smoothing as seen in the iPhone 7. This is a result of sensor improvements, but also of Apple applying deep learning and intelligence to the process of determining subjects and optimizing exposure. More on that later.As phone cameras have gotten better at low-light photography, the flash has been reduced to documenting that weird growth you text your friends and hopefully a medical professional.Hardware accelerated noise reduction. I know this is going to be a bit in the weeds for some folks, but I’m really excited about this one. Noise reduction (NR) is the process that every digital camera system uses to remove the multi-colored speckle that’s a typical byproduct of a (relatively) tiny sensor, heat and the analog-to-digital conversion process. Most people just call this “grain.”In previous iPhones this was done purely by software. Now it’s being done directly by the hardware. I’d always found Apple’s NR to be too “painterly” in its effect. The aggressive way that they chose to reduce noise created an overall “softening,” especially noticeable in photos with fine detail when cropped or zoomed.I’m still not completely happy with how much noise reduction Apple’s image signal processor (ISP) applies to pictures, but I make this statement fully aware that this is not something most folks will notice.It makes some sense that the NR would be more aggressive because most people want less ‘grain’ or pixel noise in their images. But it still results, I feel, in a little loss of sharpness in low-light situations. To be clear, this remains basically unchanged from the way that I feel about the way the ISP was tuned in the iPhone 6. Apple has made some insane improvements in the camera this time around, but I hope it does pay some attention to how they reduce noise and tweak that in the future.Well, tweak it they have. Noise reduction is no longer a software-only feature. It’s hardware-accelerated, multi-band noise reduction done by the image signal processor (ISP) that Apple continues to improve. The result is reduced noise, but with a sharper, crisper feel that doesn’t feature the blotchy byproduct of the previous process. It’s a solid improvement everyone will benefit from, whether they realize it or not.‘Zero’ shutter lagFor a while now, iPhones have been keeping a few images in memory before you even press the shutter button. These are recorded but thrown away nearly instantly. In optimal conditions, when you press the shutter, the last picture it recorded just before you pressed the shutter is the one you actually take.This helps compensate for your normal human lag in pressing the button when you see something you want to take a shot of, and the lag of the system itself. It makes the picture-taking process feel instantaneous.That buffer has gotten a bump in size in the iPhone 8, and Apple is now applying deep learning to optimize the process for the right time to shoot, the subject matter and other bits of intelligence.The results are difficult to determine without a huge set of examples, because there are a lot of variables on any given shot. But, anecdotally, it does feel like the pictures fire off faster. Verdict: I believe them, but I need more time to feel this one out.FlashOne of the main reasons you hate flash pictures is that they tend to pop the subject with tons of light and reduce the background to a blackish-gray nothing. It kills ambiance and mood and as phone cameras have gotten better at low-light photography, the flash has been reduced to documenting that weird growth you text your friends and hopefully a medical professional.But pro photographers use flash all the time. Mainly because they have control over the shutter speed as well as the flash. This allows them to choose to leave the shutter open after the flash fires, filling in the background with more light and balancing the exposure.Now, Apple does this automatically for you. If you take a flash picture of a person or thing and there’s enough light available to “fill” behind the subject, the iPhone will drag the shutter or leave it open automatically. It does this using intelligence around the subject matter, distance, ambient exposure and more in the time it takes to pop the shutter off.The beauty of all of the examples I mentioned above? Every single bit of it is as accessible to the harried parent that wants the best shot of their kid on the first day of kindergarten as it is to a pro photographer. Yes, Apple has a silicon team that’s beyond ridiculous. Yes, it’s at the cutting edge of mobile computational photography and application of deep learning to photos. But you literally don’t have to give a flying animated poop emoji about it to get the benefit.That is the key Apple innovation: It doesn’t matter whether you read, liked or understood what I just wrote above — you’re still going to benefit with incredible pictures.iPhone 7 flashiPhone 8 flashIs the camera worth the upgrade?Nearly every iPhone upgrade for the past several years has been driven by the camera. There have been impressive updates in hardware and feature additions, but anecdotally I cannot count the number of times people have cited the camera as the primary reason that they’re interested in updating their phone.So, how does the camera in the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus stack up?Killer.When people talk about Apple’s silicon team, they often concentrate on the A-series processors, which is fine. But that team also contributes heavily to the image pipeline in the iPhone’s camera systems.This is the first year that I’m not saying ‘if you like bigger screens get the bigger one, otherwise get the smaller one’ about iPhones. I flat out recommend the iPhone 8 Plus if you’re in the market for an upgrade and can possibly stand using the larger phone. Why?Portrait LightingMost people aren’t aware of this, but Apple almost never starts a development process for a piece of hardware or a feature with a goal of adding hardware or adding a feature. They start with a question. Sometimes the answer to a question like “Why do people still buy SLR cameras?” is “Because they like the look of a blurry background that separates the subject” and you end up with Portrait Mode.Now that Portrait Mode is out of beta and looking pretty good in most cases, we’re getting a big update.The marquee feature of the iPhone 8 Plus is Portrait Lighting. Using deep learning and computer vision, this mode finds faces in an image, detects the planes and angles that need to be lit and applies a variety of different lighting styles that a user can choose from either before or after the picture is taken.It works better than it has any right to.Subjects are almost without fail painted appropriately with the different styles of light. A top-down studio style light, a contoured dramatic light that enhances cheekbones and two “stage” lighting modes that drop out the background transform a regular lame snapshot into something you’re proud to throw on the ‘gram or even print out.The studio and contour options are going to be flooding social networks and phones internet-wide as soon as people get their hands on their iPhone 8 Pluses. The stage lighting takes a bit more effort, but when you nail it and the software is able to do its job by accurately detecting hair and head shapes, it really stuns. It can produce images that feel professional and would take dozens of lights and pieces of equipment to pull off.OriginalDeep learning and computer vision are the keys to Portrait Lighting.StudioStudio-style lightingContourThe drama of contour lighting enhances cheekbones.Stage effortThe stage lighting takes a bit more effort.Professional stageBut when the software accurately detects hair and head shapes, it can produce images that feel professional.That’s not a huge shock because that’s what Apple did to get this right. They took hundreds of thousands of shots using professional lighting rigs set up by master photographers and cinematographers. Then they distilled those down to a set of master characteristics and figured out how to reproduce them computationally.The feature is still in beta. But this is a look into the future of photography. All photography, not just on smartphones — though that’s quickly becoming the primary way that most people shoot pictures.There are things it will have trouble with for now, like curly or fine hair.And it’s also something else: augmented reality.While you might not jump instantly to assigning the term AR to this kind of feature, this is how Apple thinks of it. And it’s how the people that I talk to who are really excited about AR are thinking about it.It’s altering the fabric of reality to enhance, remove or augment it. And it’s going to spread to every aspect of computer vision, photography and imaging. AR isn’t just putting a virtual bird on it or dropping an Ikea couch into your living room. It’s going to be everywhere, and Apple is preparing itself to push hard in this area. All of that is enabled, of course, by custom hardware.Because the feature is still in beta, there are obviously things it will have trouble with for now, like curly or fine hair. But it’s useful on skin tones from dark to light — it was clearly tested on a wide variety of people. It’s not perfect but it’s still very impressive.What the hell does Bionic mean anyway?Nothing. At least, not specifically. The A11 Bionic chip carries that name simply to differentiate it without having to start appending a bunch of digits to it. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t different than what came before.Bionic is just marketing, but there are real machine learning advantages. It can run instructions at 16-bit instead of 32-bit for instance, for calculations that don’t need the extra overhead. This can massively speed up ML library calculations. It also does have enhanced GPU support to allow ML applications to better leverage the Apple-designed GPU. Obviously GPUs have many advantages for ML training and modeling. And yes, it does have specific enhancements that Apple uses for its own ML stuff like portrait lighting, Face ID and more.Apple is angling hard through these waters toward a future where the kinds of neural network processing that have to be done remotely can be done on device. This, of course, is a boon to privacy and security. It allows Apple to promise you that your sensitive data will never leave your hands while still being able to provide the advanced intelligence that modern features require.Apple’s A11 chip has performance that’s on par with an i5 MacBook Pro — and that’s when it’s limited by having to sit on a battery-powered device. A custom designed performance controller — a CPU traffic cop — sits between six cores tuned to higher or lower performance tasks.This is all opaque to you, the user, of course. But what it means is that you get more power but the same amount of battery life. It’s an even more impressive feat when you realize that the battery is actually physically smaller than last year’s models.There is not a single team of engineers at Apple more responsible for the success of the iPhone than its group of chip makers.Contact highWireless, or contact, charging works but you have to buy a third-party pad yourself. That’s about all there is to say about it besides it does work with a case and charges about as fast as with the standard adapter.I’ve had wireless charging on Android phones for a while, and it’s definitely handy. It’s nice to see it come to iPhones and the grab-and-go experience is lovely. We’ll see how good Apple thinks it can really make the experience when its own contact charging AirPad arrives.Living in the shadow of XAll of this, of course, sits in the shadow of the iPhone X. Had Apple not announced the X when it did, the iPhone 8 would be an easy choice for upgraders and about the same amount of take-it-or-leave-it talk by early adopters that we saw at the launch of the iPhone 7. A bunch of internal upgrades and a nice new glass back along with the new photography stuff means that Apple will sell plenty of iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Pluses.I don’t think Apple knows whether people will lean one way or the other for sure. Their guidance for this quarter certainly indicates that the matter is up in the air. But I do believe that they’re not overly concerned if people buy an iPhone 8 or an iPhone X. You’re still buying an iPhone.As far as a consumer goes, however, the iPhone 8 is the easy traditional choice this year. It’s got nearly every technical enhancement that the iPhone X has outside of the TrueDepth camera and OLED screen. I think the mental calculus on this one is probably closer than it’s ever been, but the framework is roughly the same: If you’re the kind of person who buys the high end iPhone every year then wait for the iPhone X. With the one caveat that if the notch for the depth camera on the front of the X offends you, well you have most of the major tech right in the iPhone 8.I’ve been thinking about this one, and I think the best way to categorize the iPhone X is as a superset of the iPhone 8 series. I’ll talk about that more when it comes time to discuss the X, but for now the iPhone 8 is still going to get you most of the way to “the best” — especially when it comes to the camera.The iPhone has been the world’s most popular camera for a while now, and it has become a huge reason, perhaps the primary reason, that iPhone users upgrade. Each year, improvements in silicon or design have also contributed to improvements in the iPhone as a camera. This year, Apple has done something really incredible with the Portrait Lighting mode, which is why if you’re in the market for a new iPhone, I recommend the 8 Plus.",Review: The iPhone 8 is a look into the augmented future of photography,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/19/review-iphone-8/,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/iphone8_stagelightmono.jpg,technology,us,"TechCrunch is a leading technology media property, dedicated to obsessively profiling startups, reviewing new Internet products, and breaking tech news.",en,TechCrunch,['top'],https://techcrunch.com,"{'large': '', 'small': '', 'medium': ''}",11:02:57,2017,2017-09-20 00:00:00,2017-09-18 00:00:00,2017-09-01 00:00:00,2017-07-01 00:00:00

The second…",latest,2017-09-26T16:43:18.,0.0,hacker-news,"Just another great game dev duo, this time from Brasil. Just launched Reakt https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.rockmilk.reaktSep 26Why we choose Godot EngineNow is the best moment to create a game. The first reason is that you are alive, after death you just can't make games anymore. The second reason is that the access to developing tools has never been so democratic.The Good Old DaysI still remember back in 2004 on my first semester at Computer Science Graduation course. A grown-up boy, excited to learn how to develop and start creating the crappy games that loomed in my head. I don't want to sound old or nostalgic (despite being both), but back then there was no Twitter, Facebook and whatever else younglings use nowadays to 'share information'.The best we had here in Brazil was some underground internet forums that half a dozen of anonymous hobbyists exchanged little game experiments and knowledge. I didn't even know what I had to google to start learning game development. Although GameMaker is 17 years old and RPG Maker is 24 years (!), I had never heard of them or knew someone that used them.The first class I had in college was Basic Programming and we were taught the C language. The moment I learned the basic syntax, the excited / foolish young me decided to make a Zelda: Link to the Past kinda clone / inspired game. Yeah, every novice game developer wannabe is stupid.The final exam of this class was to create a Pac-Man clone using Allegro, but NO! Pac-man is too dumb / small for the greedy game developer inside me, I want to make a Zelda kinda of game! Later I discovered that Pac-Man itself was an herculean task for someone who had just learned how to make a for loop (but this can be a topic for another article).Ignorance was bliss in my case, nothing could stop me from downloading some Zelda SNES ripped sprites and make Link able to move and collide with a rough TileMap that I’ve created from scratch (this already made me feel like a programming god). Needless to say, my Pac-Man never saw daylight, developing a 'Zelda' was much more fun.Game Engines…Game Engines EverywhereBack to present days, there are zillions of books, articles, devlogs, social networks spreading knowledge and engines. Everything for free or kinda free. Listing my top of mind quickly in a categorized way:With that we have the Paradox of Choice. There are soo many of them, which one to choose?The Underdog: Godot EngineMatheus and I have lots of experience with many engines and programming languages that we've been trying through all those years, but we must comment about the Unity Engine, which I dare to say is the most popular nowadays between small studios and indies. We used it to develop Dungeonland during the existence of our beloved Critical Studio back in 2013 and it was really good back then, comparing with the rest of the options.Some Dungeonland gameplay! Go play with 2 more friends, it's fun and free!We still think it's a great engine, especially in the 3D field. But after Critical Studio ended I've wanted to play with a simpler tool. Unity was already bloated, was slow to load and building 2D games was very hacky.I discovered HaxeFlixel (more like a framework instead of a engine) and it was great for small games, prototyping on it is very efficient and I had truly native performant code on each platform with a single code-base, and was fast to distribute a quick game for my friends using the Flash export.But I felt that something was still missing, maybe a hybrid between the two? I wanted something simple as HaxeFlixel but wanted to have more control, some kind of WYSIWYG editor or IDE like Unity was.And then, a new underdog appeared in town, the Godot Engine. It's development started back in 2007 as a proprietary engine and got open-sourced in the 2014. That's 10 years in the making showing how mature it is.When we discovered about it we felt that it had the potential to be everything I was searching and Rock Milk needed. We build Reakt as a laboratory to define a production workflow for our studio and put Godot to the test. We ended up loving it SO MUCH because every weak spot that we’ve found in other engines were better addressed on it.DisclaimerStarting a Flame War 101I have no intention of generating some kind of Flame War with other programming languages, frameworks or engines, so:We’re not saying that Godot is better / more powerful than other engines; (even so because this is a matter of perspective and necessity)We're not saying that other engines are bad;We’re not saying that there isn’t a solution for the flaws raised;We’re not saying that Godot's solutions are flawless;The main point here is to clarify why we like it and why it's better for our business and programming style. I apologize in advance if maybe I offend you somehow, really. (but don't get offended, it's not worth it)With that out of the way…Open-Source and CommunityGodot is free as in freedom and open-source forever. In practical terms:There's no indie taxes or anual / quarter calendar revenue cap;You're not forced to use their splash-screen, use their additional services or host your project files in their cloud;LightweightA Godot build takes 30MB out of your HD, with (almost) all-included. If you want to bake mobile builds, you'll have to download an additional ~200mb of build templates and that's it.I'm not bringing that up because it's fast to download or will spare 3 to 30GB that other engines would take, but to show the team's concern with performance since it's conception. Godot opens up in a blink of an eye, my notebook is 4 years old and I've never waited longer than 5 seconds for something to open or load. The maximum time I waited was about 1 minute between pushing a button and have a new debug build running on my Android phone.Version Control FriendlyHave you ever had a conflict in the repository of any scene/prefab/whatever using Unreal or Unity? So you know as I do how painfull it is, especially in bigger teams.Every object is stored as text in a very friendly and human readable format, if you ever need to merge some conflict. It’s easy to separate your objects in multiple scenes (more on that later) so each team member can focus on their own.Animation SystemGodot has the most powerfull but yet simple animation system that I've seen with all the tools that I've played with. You can animate ANY PROPERTY of a object, even function calls. Besides that, it contains a tool to create cut-out animations.Better than trying to explain in words how it works, I present you GDQuest and Heartbeast, two awesome guys that dedicate their time creating game creation instructional videos, most of them for free. Each one of them made a video about Godot's animation system:Intro to the Animation ToolsAnimating a Bat with Cut-Out Animation TechniquesReal 2D vs Fake 2DPart of Rock Milk's philosophy is to launch often. To accomplish this, we are creating small and simple games, trying to get a hit through unexplored and innovative mechanics. As we are only two family guys with a daily spare hour to work on our games, we opted to focus on 2D games for obvious reasons.Godot has a dedicated 2D engine and not a fake 2D, flattening the Z axis on a 3D space. What that means in practice while using Godot?:Pixels as Coordinates and Units, including the Physics Engine;More performance and API simplification as the engine does not need to deal logically / matematically with a third dimension;Typical workarounds used in other engines are not necessary (e.g.: setting a unit as 1 pixel, pixel-perfect rendering, z-ordering and camera zoom hacks and etc.)In other words, we have fine control over size, position, velocity and collision with each one of the game's entities, including HUD that are usually a total PITA to setup. (But we love the new Unity's GUI, just saying)GDScript and APIGDScript is the default programming language that was hand-made for Godot, making it intrinsically connected with the engine features.It's so easy to make lot's of behaviors with little coding because of it's huge API. Every object I thought I would have to create from scratch, Godot had something already done for me, with every manipulation and customization I needed included.Besides that, I believe GDScript is the main reason to keep new users away from Godot. From all complaints that I've seen around, I highlight:Do I have to learn a new language that can only be used in Godot?Yes, but it won’t take you two days. It’s a very simple language, like a Python’s brother.Worst case scenario, you will have another programming language in your pocket and learning new languages will help you think differently (in a better way) with other ones.I hate scripting languageYeah, there's no accounting for taste and there's not much I can tell you about it. But if you want to, you can write all your code in a C++ module and expose it to GDScript in a very easy way.Or maybe you want to keep Waiting for Godot 3.0 (there it is Godot Community…the joke you wanted) as it will have C# support and GDNative, that will allow to code using Python, Go, D, Rust and even Nim (or any programming language that you want to create bindings).What about it's performance? Scripting language for Games? EwwFor 95% of the games that you can imagine, I believe it will be more than enough. If you're still skeptical, as I already mentioned you can create C++ modules and get C++ performance.If there is a single part of your algorithm that needs extreme performance, you can create just that bit in C++ and the rest of the game with GDScript.Godot has a code editor integrated, and besides being a scripted language it makes a beautiful job with intelisense (a.k.a. code completion) and powerful debugging, including Live Editing, as Juan Linietsky (a.k.a. Reduzio), the lead Godot dev, shows here:My sugestion: Try GDScript out before criticizing it. If you're not fluent and very productive in one week, I'll give you a candy.Still not convinced? Check Juan's reasonings about GDScript creation, it may change your mind:Node and Scene SystemNode is a basic object for your game that you can edit it's properties. It can be a 2D Sprite, a 3D Model, some GUI element or just play sound. Godot comes with LOTS of them ready to be used and extended, so you can create your own node types. Scene is a group of nodes organized hierarchically, like in a tree.This is our favorite feature hands down and the best way to explain it is through this:I'm sorry about the language (I'm lying)Everything in Godot is a scene. Each one can contain other scenes and nodes. You can easily extract some sub-trees and create a scene of it's own, increasing scene reusability, as fracteed used cleverly on those pipes:For your better understanding, I'm going to compare this with Unity:In Unity a GameObject behavior is composed by adding multiple components. Every component is a script, so a object can have multiple scripts; (duh)In Godot, each node can have only one script, but it comes with it's basic functionality already implemented. You define a GameObject through a scene, composed of multiple nodes and other scenes. That means that you have nested prefabs by default. See an example of a Player GameObject, from Godot's official docs:Minor setbacks, but a solution is on it's wayDuring Reakt development, we found some minor bugs and quirks using Godot version 2.3.1:I have a Macbook Pro Retina 13''. Depending on the Godot tool that I was using, some GUI panels were so tight and some buttons were above others GUI elements, but nothing that would make them impossible to useWhen leaving the Animation Tool it sets the edited node default state to the last used state on the tool, we had to reset the node to it's original configuration several times. As a late solution, we've created a default state animation that had to be selected before closing the toolBesides that, our only real bottleneck was integrating third-party mobile libraries, mostly business ones like Analytics, Ads plus Mediations Networks and Crash Report. Creating native modules in Godot 2 is very cumbersome: you have to download the engine source, create and include native modules in a specific folder, compile the engine and then compile the module debug and release versions. This will generate a new mobile template that you can use in your game and hope that everything works fine, if not, you have to debug your module through console with a USB cable attached to your mobile phone. Phew…After everything is setup and you get used to it, is pretty quick to regenerate everything. On our first game we only used Godot-Firebase, created by Frog-Square (thanks for the help Ramesh!).We wanted to implement other mediation networks as well (Firebase only has AdMob) but the cost-benefit ratio would be not worthy right now, because as I already mentioned Reakt was just a lab project and GDNative is already working in Godot Engine 3. We'll be able to use them without needing to go though all compiling process I've previously explained, with a bug-fix bonus from all other problems we had.So, Godot 3.0 is almost there……but that's not an excuse for not playing with it right now! You have to experiment with it to understand everything I've just said.Really, check this video with all features already working on v3.0:And also check the engine's roadmap, it's pure game development bliss. ❤Besides that , Godot has a Patreon and it just reached it’s first milestone, allowing Juan to work full-time developing the engine.I really hope that I've convinced you to join this awesome community and help to speed up Godot Engine growth. Did I managed to convince you? Then, start learning!:",Why we choose Godot Engine,https://medium.com/@rockmilkgames/why-godot-engine-e0d4736d6eb0,https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*SEVzpXNWKqniIwMG2gA-dA.png,technology,us,"Hacker News is a social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship.

4696,7993,Thomas Ring,2017-09-26 17:28:12,And how not to handle reported vulnerabilities,latest,2017-09-26T17:28:12.,0.0,hacker-news,"How I Hacked DePauw University Using Hidden InputsAnd how not to handle reported vulnerabilitiesFor the past month I have been in a conflict with my undergrad university, DePauw, over a vulnerability I found involving university provided student mailboxes. I have been threatened while also being told that they are grateful for what I’ve done.Over this article I will explain the technicals of the vulnerability, the response from the university and the chain of events that made this the situation it is now, as well as my opinion on the whole thing.In late August, I discovered a form with hidden inputs in DePauw University’s student E-Services site. The link was used to direct students to a webpage containing their university mailbox number and combination.Note: If you are not interested in the technicals of the hack, please skip below to “University Reaction.”This link was different from all the other links, because it was not an <a> tag ( usually used for HTML link objects), but a <form> tag with inputs that were set to be hidden. Additionally, the form had a type field set to sqlform (research on this returned nothing which may suggest it was used by the original developer as documentation into how the form worked). However, the hidden input here had an interesting name: Student ID.Exploiting Hidden FormsHidden inputs are sometimes used with the assumption that no one will open up an inspector and submit data other than the data in the formatted webpage. The Mozilla page (also linked above) for hidden inputs even adds that a use case would be security data, such as a token that would invalidate the form if it was changed. Because of this assumption, input sanitization may be looked over or completely forgotten.That is exactly the case with the form I found. The Student ID field, which can be edited using the Chrome Web Inspector, was not sanitized.I asked a friend for their Student ID to test this potential vulnerability. Sure enough, submitting the form with the modified data was enough for the system to spit out the correlating mailbox number and combination.This was scary. This hole may have existed and exploited for years without anyone knowing. The HTML 2.0 (1995) specification includes hidden inputs, but it’s unlikely that this webpage has existed for 22 years. That being said, it is still a possibility.Logs exist that can trace exploitation retroactively, but searching them takes an extremely long time and effort that is put to better use by patching the hole (fix the leak) and changing the combinations (clean up the mess).I submitted a report to the HelpDesk (University IT department) as well as some upper level management detailing the vulnerability with steps to reproduce.However, I suspected that the problem was worse than I had initially found. If the input data is not sanitized, as well as the fact that the form is of type sqlform, could it be vulnerable to an SQL-injection?There are a number of SQL-injections that can have devastating, irreversible effects on a system, so in choosing my injection I needed to be careful. Instead of trying to execute a DROP TABLE attack, which may delete the database forever, one could insert OR 1=1. I was working with the assumption that submitting the form would execute:Because 1=1 is always true, this statement evaluates TRUE for every row in the table. Subsequently, every single mailbox number and correlating combination were returned, viewable from Chrome.I promptly submitted this issue, hoping to show the university that their problem is much worse than my initial email suggests. The problem was promptly fixed before the end of the day.The University’s ReactionAll university faculty names and position titles have been censored for their protection.For finding a vulnerability that leaked thousands of personal information, I was expecting to be met with complete gratitude. I was prepared to ask permission to write an article about what had happened, which was the only reward I wanted at the time.A meeting was set for Monday, August 28, with one of the system administrators so that they could make sure to get all the technical details from me. Since the vulnerability was fixed, I asked if I could publish an article about the leak online. I was told that the system administrator did not have the authority and that I would have to wait until my next meeting, where a higher-up would detail exactly what was going to happen.My meeting with the higher-up was set for Wednesday, August 30, to discuss and hopefully wrap up the discussion about what was going to happen. I faced a series of questions including why I did it as well as what my intentions were. I was also notified that every single mailbox combination would need to be changed because of the vulnerability, and it was suggested that this was a direct consequence of my actions, a statement which would later be explicitly expressed. Upon asking if I could publish an article detailing the leak, I was told that they would prefer I did not release any information, but that they could not stop me since they were not the police.The third meeting, which was set up via text message via the higher-up’s secretary a few hours before the requested meeting time, took place Thursday, August 31. I was met with another line of questions similar to the previous meeting, but for another university representative that would like to get the information from me first-hand. I was then told that the university is not going to reveal my identity and asked that I not reveal myself for any of the following reasons:Future employers may see this and not be interested in hiring me because I might “poke around” their system.An angry board member may ask to have me punished for my actions.Students may be angry with me and act vindictively.Publicizing details about this will make DePauw, my alma matter, look bad. Why would I want to do that?I broke the Student Code of Conduct by misusing university information systems, but they were not going to pursue any action. However if I were to publish a blog post/article detailing what happened, then “we may need to look into that.”I was then reminded of the consequences of my actions (all of the mailboxes were going to be changed the next week) and was asked what I thought about that.It was at this point that I told them that it is not my fault that the changes have to happen but the fact that their system was vulnerable in the first place and that this may have been exploited any number of times, and mail may have been stolen in the past as a result. This moment was significant because this was the first time, in all of my meetings, where I chose to interject my opinion into the conversation, and it would not be the last.I was then told that the university may have a responsibility to report me to the police because the information I accessed was sensitive enough that I may have broken the law.Afterwards, my father contacted a lawyer because my alma matter was suggesting they may turn me into law enforcement.Going PublicAn email went out at 7:23am on September 4, detailing to the student body what had occurred:A week later, The DePauw, the student run newspaper at DePauw University, was tipped off about my role in the mailboxes. I was notified that I had an opportunity to sit down and interview, as well as reveal my role in the mailboxes. After contemplation, I agreed to a short sit down interview.After the article was published on September 12, I was approached multiple times by faculty and students saying that what the university was doing was unbelievably wrong and that I was in the right. Some faculty even approached me saying that they were willing to do whatever they can to make this right, including writing letters and emails to the administration.Additional VulnerabilitiesWith the student body and faculty now backing me, I was comfortable finding more vulnerabilities in the system. My naive belief was that the university would admit to their mistakes and accept my help.Two vulnerabilities were obtained using the same method as above, but for two different sources:A schedule of all of the spring classes which has not been officially released.A portal to edit my current Fall schedule, which should have been closed weeks ago and should cost an additional fee to use.I submitted these and they were patched within a day.Follow-Up MeetingA week later, on September 22, I had my final meeting with the second higher-up as a wrap-up of the whole situation, as well as find out if the university would be pursing action against me.I was first told that no action would be taken against me (phew!). I was also told that the university was surprised that I reported being ‘off-put’ by their actions and that they believed they were acting according to their responsibilities. We then proceeded to talk through the following letter:In response, one of the main points I tried to make is how authentication on a server works and permissions of data on a system. I was authenticated to access data at a student level, and data (mailbox combinations) were accidentally treated as accessible by students, which is how I was able to access the data. This was not accepted and I was told that I accessed unauthorized data by tampering and/or “poking around” university information systems.In addition to everything in the letter, I was told that the university is hiring “outside people to come and fix the system,” which may mean a full security audit, something that should have been done and announced at the first report. I was also told that because of these paid professionals, my work would no longer be welcome and will be met with punishment.ConclusionI have attempted to tell a linear story of the events that occurred while leaving my opinion out so that you, the reader, has the opportunity to form your own opinion on the subject. That being said, I do have opinions about everything that has happened that I feel need to be heard.First, the reaction of changing the codes took over 12 days after the vulnerability was found. This means that any of the following may be true:The university knows exactly how many times this vulnerability was used in all of the time that the system has existed because they do not flush logs and searched through all of them.The university did not consider that this data may have already been used maliciously and they should be changing the locks as soon as possible.The university assumed I am the only attacker and that I would not be using it maliciously.The biggest problem I see with what happened is that the university was so focused on keeping me quiet that they threatened legal action, while citing reasons such as “for my protection,” and that it would damage the same alma matter that was threatening me in the first place. Transparency in situations where information has been leaked is so important, and when the email reads “a limited amount of information was accessed” and not “all of the information has been leaked,” I think that there is something that must be done to notify those impacted.There are five reasons above that the university cited for me to keep quiet. I’d like to address all five here:Negative image for future employers: I have been contacted by several different companies regarding employment opportunities since the article in The DePauw was released. Also, most companies reward this behavior.Angry board member: This problem is an indicator of more problems that exist at DePauw University that I will not go into here.Vindictive students: Not a single student has approached me with a negative opinion, and I have only heard of one student who defends the university’s decisions.My alma matter’s image: I’m fairly sure that the image of the university is currently worse than if the university decided to award one of the students that used knowledge gained at DePauw to help them build a more secure system. Now it looks like an institution that frowns upon using one’s knowledge for the benefit of the university.Publicizing information may get me in trouble: Is it ever okay to use censorship to ensure a certain narrative is the narrative believed by the population?This whole process has been enlightening yet disappointing for me. At one point I realized that I was able to outsmart a university engineer, which was personally validating of my own skills. The consequences of which were that the university tried to cover it up and keep me quiet, disappointed me in how forward thinking I think this university is.",How I Hacked DePauw University Using Hidden Inputs,https://medium.com/@thomasring/how-i-hacked-depauw-university-using-hidden-inputs-79377c3dca7e,https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*WUIsMvAtrbvjZiDsR9rXrg.jpeg,technology,us,"Hacker News is a social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship.

4697,7994,Mapbox,2017-09-27 00:06:53,Hacking together a new way to use React components and markdown,latest,2017-09-27T00:06:53.,0.0,hacker-news,"Introducing jsxtreme-markdownHacking together a new way to use React components and markdownRecently, the Mapbox Design team was exploring ways to leverage the power of Javascript and React components without losing the ease-of-use of markdown and Jekyll. What we ended up creating was jsxtreme-markdown, a tool to transform markdown with interpolated Javascript expressions and React components into pure JSX. If a challenge like this interests you, check out our opening for a front-end engineer position.We’ve been using Jekyll to build Mapbox websites for a long time. Jekyll is a static website generator that transforms markdown (using the Liquid templating engine), HTML, and CSS into static, ready-to-serve files. Everyone at Mapbox learns to write markdown due to our extensive use of Github, and it’s incredibly powerful. With markdown, our content writers can focus exclusively on the content and its prose.Our goal was to find a way to retain the same features that Jekyll affords us but also leverage the power of dynamically rendered, component-based Javascript applications (for robust interactivity, repeatable design patterns, client-side routing, code splitting, better development tooling, and more).React and Webpack are two other tools we use to build robust and performant web applications. And with such active open source communities, they provide a fantastic developer experience. We didn’t want to abandon what markdown is really good at — building templated, repetitious content web pages. So how do we leverage the power of interactive web applications and the development tools for our static websites without forcing everyone to learn a new syntax (JSX and Javascript)?There are several really useful tools that can convert markdown to Javascript files. They almost provided everything we needed, but not quite — the ideal solution had to encourage people to continue contributing content in markdown without discouraging the use of reusable React components. This is why we thought it would be smart to use React components and Javascript expressions in the same way our content writers use Liquid templating directly in markdown. So David Clark embarked on the journey of building this tool, and thus jsxtreme-markdown was gifted to the world.jsxtreme-markdown provides flexible, low-level tools that transform markdown into pure JSX, optionally interspersed with run-time Javascript expressions and JSX components. This combines all of the things we love about markdown, liquid templating, React components, and modern tooling. In effect, it allows our content writers to mix interactive elements of arbitrary complexity with natural prose.Here’s a basic example:{{ <FancyReactContentWrapper> }}This is a **Markdown** paragraph inside our `FancyReactContentWrapper`. We can even access our frontmatter variables in our Javascript expressions, like this: {{ `Foo is ${frontMatter.foo}` }}jsxtreme-markdown, a script which does the actual conversion of markdown, optionally with interpolated run-time Javascript expressions and JSX) into JSX, and creates a React component module which renders the result of the transformationWe split up these three packages to avoid locking users into any particular build tool. If you don’t use Webpack or Babel, that’s no problem! You can still use jsxtreme-markdown on its own, or build a plugin for your workflow of choice (e.g. gulp-jsxtreme-markdown).jsxtreme-markdown-loader allows you to leverage the use of Webpack, so that your markdown files can be treated just like any other Javascript components.One of the challenges faced in developing this tool was interpolating the Javascript expressions and JSX in the markdown.During implementation, we realized it would be necessary to replace the Javascript expressions and JSX elements with unique placeholder IDs, in order to accurately re-insert into the interpolated markup. Some clever tricks were employed to ensure this solution worked with our chosen syntax highlighter, highlights, which runs at compile time. Check out the placeholders logic.Another challenge was the seemingly daunting task of creating the Webpack loader and Babel plugin. As it turns out, they don’t have to be complicated. Both tools make the process simple and straightforward, allowing the loader and plugin logic to be simple as well. Check out the code for yourself: Webpack loader and Babel pluginMany Mapbox websites are already using jsxtreme-markdown. We recently ported our Android documentation, and we’re pleased with the results so far.",Introducing jsxtreme-markdown,https://blog.mapbox.com/introducing-jsxtreme-markdown-a64c6b404596,https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*AHOGgKnSyatWSGm-qTbjYA.png,technology,us,"Hacker News is a social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship.

Echo Show owners weren’t given any advance warning previous to the removal.An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the service had been pulled in a statement, also implying that the move came as a surprise to them.Google made a change today around 3 pm. YouTube used to be available to our shared customers on Echo Show. As of this afternoon, Google has chosen to no longer make YouTube available on Echo Show, without explanation and without notification to customers. There is no technical reason for that decision, which is disappointing and hurts both of our customers.In a statement given to The Verge, which first reported the removal, Google contradicts the Amazon statement, saying that they’ve been working with the company, but that the implementation of YouTube on the Echo Show violates the service’s ToS.We’ve been in negotiations with Amazon for a long time, working towards an agreement that provides great experiences for customers on both platforms. Amazon’s implementation of YouTube on the Echo Show violates our terms of service, creating a broken user experience. We hope to be able to reach an agreement and resolve these issues soon.We’ve reached out to Google for more information.For the time being the messaging coming out from both companies is pretty contradictory, but Google’s statement inspires some hope that YouTube will be returning to the Echo Show if Amazon deigns to make the changes that Google allegedly wants them to. Amazon probably doesn’t have much of a choice here, losing YouTube would be a pretty massive blow to the company’s only smart speaker with a screen.A more pronounced war between Amazon and Google wouldn’t be beneficial to anyone given the essential services both companies offer, but given the interconnectedness of the companies best interests suggest this would be pretty unlikely.",Google suddenly removes YouTube access from the Amazon Echo Show,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/google-suddenly-removes-youtube-access-from-the-amazon-echo-show/,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/dsc00717.jpg,technology,us,"TechCrunch is a leading technology media property, dedicated to obsessively profiling startups, reviewing new Internet products, and breaking tech news.",en,TechCrunch,['top'],https://techcrunch.com,"{'large': '', 'small': '', 'medium': ''}",02:14:50,2017,2017-09-28 00:00:00,2017-09-25 00:00:00,2017-09-01 00:00:00,2017-07-01 00:00:00

""Competition for new technology in the automotive industry is fierce and we must do everything we can to keep the specifics of our vehicle confidential,"" he told staff in an email.Important points that are undecided or secret include the firm's expected annual production total, the cost of the car, or its range or top speed.Sir James said about £1bn would be spent on developing the car, with another £1bn on making the battery.Analysis: Richard Westcott, BBC transport correspondentIt was a slightly unusual launch, but then, Sir James Dyson likes to be different.In a small room above his swanky London shop he told us about his vision for a clean car.First up, we were treated to an old clip of Blue Peter, from the 90s, where Anthea Turner interviewed him about his new device to clean soot from the exhaust of diesel vehicles... it was the cyclone from his vacuum cleaner, put to a different use.""That is how long I have wanted to do this,"" he told us.In fact he first hatched the idea in the late 1980s.Since then, he has developed motors and batteries and now he is able to bring all that expertise together in a new, electric car.He promised that it will be radical and different, because, as he put it, what is the point of making it like any other car?And he promised that it will not be cheap.I did ask how much it would be to put down a deposit... he told me he would have to think about it.Further development work will take place at a former RAF base at Hullavington in Wiltshire, where staff will move to in February.Sir James also said that his firm's car would look ""radical and different"", but will not be aimed at the mass market.The motor is designed and ready to go, he said, but the firm is still designing the car.Dyson's decision means it is joining the rush within the global car industry to develop and make electric cars.Sir James said he had been interested since 1990 in developing filtration technology to stop vehicle diesel emissions polluting the environment.But as the motor industry had shown no interest in adopting this idea, he would instead join the fast-growing trend to make electric vehicles.Analysis: Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondentThe electric car market is growing rapidly, but it is also about to become a lot more crowded.Within the next few years, many new models are due to come on to the market, including Jaguar's Ipace, Porsche's Mission E, Volkswagen's I.D. family and Mercedes' EQ range. Tesla also has big plans for its recently launched Model 3.They will be joining established models such as the Nissan Leaf, the BMW i3, the Renault Zoe and the Tesla Model S.Dyson clearly sees an opportunity here. As new designs become available, and prices come down, more consumers will be willing to try electric vehicles.Policymakers, concerned about air pollution, want them to do just that.The big question is whether Dyson can muscle in on territory that the major manufacturers are already trying to make their own. And let's not forget Google's designs on the electric/self-driving market.Tesla was able to build a new car brand from scratch, but only by producing a design which effectively moved the goalposts and changed people's expectations of what an electric car could provide.If Dyson wants to play with the big boys, it may have to pull off a similar trick.",Dyson to make electric cars from 2020,http://www.bbc.com/news/business-41399497,https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/10BDC/production/_98027586_jamesdyson-heathcliffomalley2.jpg,technology,us,"Hacker News is a social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship.

While other, older tweets in support of Strange remain up, these three were replaced by a new one.Congratulations to Roy Moore on his Republican Primary win in Alabama.

Without Josh's help I would still be scratching my head over this bizarre issue.It started with one user reporting the bug. They couldn't submit any data to Exist, all of a sudden. The app's POST methods were always failing, but the GET methods were fine. They could open the app and view their data, but they couldn't submit custom tags or a mood rating for the day.This is obviously problematic. A big part of the mobile app's functionality is to help users get their data into Exist, since our web app offers more in-depth ""read"" capabilities with graphs and charts. In the background, Exist for iOS also sends the users Apple Health data (if they've turned the feature on) to Exist, so I knew those POST requests would also be failing.Not long after this first report, I got a second report of the same bug. When users submit a bug report from within the app, a text file of logs gets attached to their email. The logs from both users told me this was a 403 error. But that makes no sense. A 403 error means the user isn't authorised. Usually that means they need to log in. But if the user wasn't authorised to make a POST request, they wouldn't be authorised to do a GET request, either. But both users were able to open the app and read their data from the API without issue. They just couldn't POST any data.Of course, the first thing that made sense was that my POST and GET requests worked differently, somehow. My POST request method must look for the user's auth token in a different place to the GET requests, and the token had somehow been moved or destroyed. Remember, not all users had this problem. And I couldn't replicate it at all. So my app's POST requests worked fine—most of the time. But for these particular users, POST requests were failing every single time after something particular happened.But there was nothing obviously wrong with my code. My POST and GET requests had the same headers, the same timeout parameters, and looked in the same place for the user's auth token. I couldn't find anything different between them that seemed like it could be causing this bug.At this point, I had feedback from the users experiencing this bug that logging out and back in (which clears the app's keychain and cache data) didn't solve the issue, but that deleting and reinstalling the app did. This only puzzled me further, but at least it gave me something I could tell users who had discovered this bug.After more fruitless exploring of my networking code, and every interaction my app has with the keychain, and many discussions that led to dead ends, Josh put on his serious debugging hat and helped me dig into this further. See, although I was seeing a 403 ""forbidden"" error, I was also getting an error message I'd never seen before:CSRF Failed: Referer checking failed - no Referer.Initially I'd thought this must be a clue as to what the issue was, and went digging into GitHub issues for Django Rest Framework, which we use to help provide our server-side API. But I didn't turn up anything useful, and Josh was adamant that I must not be sending the Authorization header correctly in these cases. CSRF, or ""Cross-Site Request Forgery"", is a method of preventing malicious requests by making sure all requests match specific criteria. Josh knew that if it didn't find an OAuth2 token in the request, the API fell back to using cookie-based ""session authentication"", so developers can look at it in their browser if they're logged in to Exist. This session authentication is the spot where CSRF validation happens, so to trigger that, somehow the API must not have received my auth token.While I googled for ideas on how my auth headers might be getting stripped out of my requests, Josh took to the command line to attempt to replicate the error message I was seeing. But here's the rub: he couldn't do it. Sending no auth header, incorrect auth headers, whatever he tried ended in a more specific authorisation error. He couldn't get the server to return the CSRF error that I was seeing.With a little more digging, Josh was able to find this comment on a GitHub issue that explains how CSRF won't ever be triggered unless the user is authorised. All of this CSRF business was starting to point to the fact that the server seemed to think my app was a browser (or at least was pretending to be a browser) for these POST requests. But I wasn't sending any cookies, or doing anything else to make my app seem like a browser. And it was only in these particular cases—I think four users have reported this, in total—whereas all our other users were able to do POST requests just fine.I suddenly remembered that pre-iOS 11 using a Safari View Controller in your app would share the cookies and other data from Safari with your app's web view. This seemed like a dead-end, since I'm not using any Safari View Controllers in my app—but I do use a WKWebView. In a couple of places I load a simple help page from our server inside a web view.Josh realised my app might be somehow getting cookies from visiting our site inside this web view, and then sharing those cookies with AFNetworking's underlying NSURLSession, which is handling my requests. We didn't really understand how this could happen, since those help pages are just simple text-based pages with no links to Exist or web app menus of any kind, but it seemed to make sense. And when we turned up confirmation that NSURLConnection, which used to underly AFNetworking before NSURLSession was introduced, does automatically use cookies from an app's web view in all future requests, it seemed we were onto something.After much trial and error, we discovered the culprit. One of those help pages helpfully links the user to a related settings page within our app which we had totally forgotten about. Because it's inside a web view, tapping that link opens the settings page in our web app inside the web view, where some users would go ahead and log in so they could adjust those settings.For those users, the web view stored the cookies created when they completed a browser log in, and NSURLSessionoh so helpfullyauto-fucking-matically decided I would probably—no, definitely—want to send those cookies in every single request my app did after that. Forever and always.So here's why it was all so confusing: whenever I did a GET request, those cookies were enough for the server to respond with the user's data, as if they were using a browser. But when doing a POST request, Django Rest Framework adds an extra layer of security with CSRF, as it should. And so the CSRF check was failing every time, because I wasn't sending a Referer header, or any other related CSRF bits. So the server really did think my app was a browser, but not for any obvious or visible reason that I could find in my code.And of course, I didn't even know about these cookies, so I wasn't deleting them on log out. The only way to clear them was to delete the app entirely and reinstall it.I've since fixed this bug by removing the link to said settings screen entirely, and stopping the web view from persisting cookies with a nonPersistentDataStore like so:Unfortunately, I can't release the fix yet, because Apple is holding us up in other fun ways. But as soon as we can release updates to the App Store again, I'll be able to send the results of this long and arduous bug fix journey to all my users.","A bizarre ""403 Forbidden"" bug-hunting adventure",http://blog.hellocode.co/post/bug-hunting/,http://hellocode.co/static/img/pics/avatar.png,technology,us,"Hacker News is a social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship.
